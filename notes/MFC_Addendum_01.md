# Where Disagreement Enters: Permissibility, Factivity, and the Minimal Constraint on Being

## Purpose and Scope

This document clarifies **where genuine disagreement about the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) actually arises**, and why such disagreement rarely appears as a direct denial of its core claim. The aim is not to restate the MFC, but to isolate the precise fault lines at which resistance occurs and to show why those fault lines involve **background commitments about what metaphysics is for**, rather than disputes over any single premise.

The analysis remains internal to the existing framework. It does not appeal to external authorities, traditions, or examples beyond those already licensed by the corpus.

## 1. The Illusion of Consensus

At first encounter, the MFC appears almost trivially true:

> If something exists, there must be a difference between its being the case and its not being the case.

Very few interlocutors are willing to deny this outright. As a result, disagreement with the MFC rarely takes the form of rejecting its conclusion. Instead, resistance takes the form of **reinterpreting what is at stake**—most often by weakening, deflecting, or reclassifying the role of existence itself.

This creates the illusion that there is broad agreement, followed by confusion about why the MFC is taken to be controversial. The controversy does not concern the surface claim, but the **constraints it imposes on metaphysical practice**.

---

## 2. The Core Commitment the MFC Makes Explicit

The MFC forces explicit endorsement of a commitment that many metaphysical positions leave implicit:

> **Metaphysics is about actuality—about what is the case—not merely about what is permitted, conceivable, or not ruled out.**

Once this commitment is made explicit, disagreement becomes inevitable. But it does not appear as disagreement with the MFC’s stated principle. It appears as disagreement about whether metaphysics should be answerable to actuality at all.

## 3. Permissibility as the Hidden Alternative

Positions that resist the MFC typically treat existence in a **permissive** rather than **factive** way.

Under a permissive framing:

* To say that something exists is not to say that reality is thereby one way rather than another.
* Existence places no positive constraint on how things are.
* Ontological claims function as allowed posits rather than claims about actuality.

Such positions do not usually announce themselves as denying factivity. Instead, they preserve the *language* of being while quietly severing it from any requirement to make a difference to what is the case.

The MFC directly targets this move.

## 4. Why Disagreement Is Rarely Direct

Direct disagreement with the MFC would require endorsing a position of the following form:

> Reality can be exactly the same whether something exists or does not exist, and this still counts as there being something the case.

Very few are willing to say this explicitly. Instead, resistance takes indirect forms that avoid confronting this implication head-on.

These forms of resistance can be grouped into four recurrent strategies.

---

## 5. Strategy One: Reclassifying Metaphysics

Some resist the MFC by denying that metaphysics is primarily about actuality at all. On this view:

* Metaphysics concerns possibility, permissibility, or conceptual space.
* It is not tasked with saying how reality is, only with what may be coherently entertained.

Under this conception, the MFC appears overreaching—not because it is false, but because it is seen as imposing an illegitimate demand on metaphysics.

The disagreement here is not over the MFC’s logic, but over **what metaphysics is supposed to do**.

---

## 6. Strategy Two: Formalizing Existence

Another common response is to treat existence as a purely formal or theoretical marker:

* “Exists” plays a role within a system of inference or description.
* No correspondence to actuality is required.

On this view, asking whether existence makes a difference to reality is a category mistake. Existence is not meant to refer in the first place.

The MFC rejects this move by insisting that if existence does not refer, then metaphysics has abandoned its subject matter rather than refined it.

---

## 7. Strategy Three: Appealing to Ineffability or Non-Duality

A third form of resistance appeals to realities said to be “beyond distinction,” “prior to difference,” or “ineffable.”

Here the attachment is not to permissibility as such, but to a positive claim about reality:

* that it is undifferentiated,
* that nothing determinate is the case,
* that all contrasts fail to apply.

The MFC does not deny the meaningfulness of limit claims of this sort. It denies only that such claims can function as assertions about being **without reintroducing factivity at the meta-level**.

To say that reality is ineffable is still to say that something is the case about reality. The MFC simply insists that this commitment be acknowledged.

---

## 8. Strategy Four: Vacuous Difference

Finally, some concede that existence must involve “difference,” but allow that the difference need not exclude anything, constrain anything, or discriminate anything in principle.

This preserves the word “difference” while emptying it of function.

The MFC rules this out as ontologically idle: a difference that makes no difference is no difference at all. This is not a semantic stipulation but a constraint on facthood.

---

## 9. The Source of Attachment

What unifies these strategies is not confusion, but **attachment**.

Those who resist the MFC are typically attached to claims they take to be genuinely about reality:

* that it is radically open,
* that it exceeds all determination,
* that it cannot be constrained.

The irony is that each of these is taken to be something that *is the case*. The resistance arises not from a rejection of factivity, but from a desire to assert actuality **without being accountable to it**.

The MFC blocks this possibility.

## 10. Conclusion: Why the Disagreement Is Structural

Disagreement about the MFC is not primarily about its truth. It is about whether metaphysics should tolerate claims of existence that make no difference to what is the case.

Once that question is faced directly, the dialectical situation becomes clear:

* Accept the MFC, and existence must earn its keep by marking actuality.
* Reject it, and metaphysics becomes permissive to the point of vacuity.

There is no stable middle position. The appearance of widespread agreement masks a deeper structural divide about what it is to do metaphysics at all.
