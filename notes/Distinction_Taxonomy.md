# Distinction-Space Taxonomy

A minimal ontology describing how structure emerges from the primitive act of distinction.  
There are **four ontological layers** (0–3), followed by one **epistemic term** (Partition), which is *not* a layer.

Boundaries between layers are **emergent and non-discrete**.  
Distinction→Frame and Sieve→Mesh are conceptually distinguishable but ontologically continuous.

## 0. Distinction
**Definition:**  
A *distinction* is the primitive act/event of marking a difference—an operation that introduces contrast and enables relational structure.

**Key Points:**  
- Distinction is generative, not descriptive.  
- It creates the minimal conditions for relational meaning.  
- A distinction implicitly produces context.  
- Distinction and Framehood co-arise and cannot exist independently.

---

## 1. Frame
**Definition:**  
A *Frame* is the minimal relational context that arises automatically when distinctions stand in relation.

Frames are:
- coherent but not stabilized,  
- relational but not rule-like,  
- enabling but not constraining.

**Properties:**  
- Allow primitive counting, ordering, symmetry.  
- Provide the relational substrate from which stabilization can emerge.

**Relationship to Layer 0:**  
- Frames emerge wherever distinctions exist.  
- Layers 0 and 1 are conceptually distinct but ontologically inseparable.

## 2. Sieve
**Definition:**  
A *Sieve* is a Frame whose relational patterns undergo **recursive stabilization**—patterns feed back into themselves and bias subsequent distinctions.

This marks the emergence of proto-rules.

**Properties:**  
- Reinforcement cycles  
- Partial constraints  
- Proto-law behavior  
- Gradual, not abrupt emergence  
- Strength varies by depth of stabilization

### How Sievehood Is Determined (Crucial Principle)

> **Sievehood cannot be inferred from static form, even in principle.**  
> It is a property of **recursive iteration**—visible only through the unfolding of distinction-updates.

This is because:
- Stabilization depends on recurrence, not static configuration.  
- Computational irreducibility forbids shortcut prediction of stabilization.  
- Observers can “recognize” sieves only from within an already-stabilized Mesh.  
- Gödel incompleteness ensures no Mesh can fully expose its own generative basis.

### Implication for Physical “Laws”

> **What appear as the “laws of physics” are not fundamental laws,  
> but the stabilized, interpolated regularities of a Mesh observed from within it.**

Observers perceive lawlike behavior only because they inhabit the long-settled outputs of recursive sieve dynamics.  
These “laws” are therefore **emergent tendencies**, not prescriptive absolutes.

## 3. Mesh
**Definition:**  
A *Mesh* is a network of interacting Sieves forming a coherent higher-order system of constraints.  
A Mesh is a **deep, multi-sieve stabilization**, where many feedback loops interlock.

**Properties:**  
- Systemic regularities  
- Rich relational architecture  
- Deeply interdependent constraints  
- Supports many possible high-level regimes

**Important Clarification:**  
A Mesh **may** give rise to:
- agent-like structures,  
- computation-like processes,  
- world-like or spacetime-like regimes,

but **none are required**.  
A Mesh is defined solely by the depth and interdependence of its stabilization, not by specific emergent outcomes.

---

# Partition (Epistemic Term — Not a Layer)

A **Partition** is an observer-relative *selection* within distinction-space.  
It is not ontological structure, but an act performed by a Mesh when restricting attention.

**Properties:**  
- Picks out regions of Frames, Sieves, or Meshes.  
- Exists only for embedded observers.  
- No global partitioning of distinction-space is possible.  
- Describes how observers refer, not how reality forms.

# Summary Table

| Layer | Name        | Core Feature                                      | Stabilization | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| **0** | Distinction | Primitive act of differentiation                  | N/A           | Co-arises with Frame |
| **1** | Frame       | Minimal emergent relational context               | None          | Immediate consequence of distinction |
| **2** | Sieve       | Recursive stabilization; proto-rules              | Partial       | Identifiable only via iterative evolution |
| **3** | Mesh        | Interlocked sieves forming coherent systems       | Strong        | May yield world-like regimes, but not necessarily |

**Partition** → Epistemic selection only; not a layer.
