# Outline: The Identity of Intelligibility and Possibility

## I. Point of Departure
- Ontology has already been shown to require distinction.
- This result is independent of epistemology, language, psychology, or factivity.
- The present task is not to introduce new metaphysical primitives, but to examine what *possibility* can coherently amount to once distinction is taken as fundamental.

## II. Minimal Structure Required for “Possibility”
- To call something “possible” is not merely to gesture or to negate actuality.
- Even minimal modal attribution (“possibly P”) presupposes:
  - determinacy (P is one way rather than another),
  - contrast (P vs not-P),
  - identity conditions (what counts as P across contexts).
- These are not optional additions; without them, “possibility” loses content.

## III. Distinction as the Source of Modal Structure
- Determinacy, contrast, and identity are all functions of distinction.
- Without distinction, there is no basis for:
  - individuating alternatives,
  - distinguishing one state from another,
  - or even specifying what an “alternative” would be.
- Therefore, any intelligible appeal to possibility already presupposes distinction.

## IV. Rejection of a Pre-Given Modal Space
- The common picture treats possibility as a space that exists prior to, or independently of, intelligibility.
- On this picture, intelligibility merely filters or accesses an already constituted modal realm.
- This picture is rejected.
- There is no coherent account of a modal space whose elements lack the structure required for distinction.

## V. The Illusion of “Possible but Unintelligible”
- Claims about “possible but unintelligible” states rely on linguistic tokenability rather than structural content.
- Arbitrary strings, gestures, or negations do not suffice to specify possibilities.
- Where distinction fails, there is not an ineffable possibility, but an absence of modal content altogether.
- The appearance of excess possibility is an artifact of unconstrained language, not of ontology.

## VI. Identity Claim
- Possibility does not extend beyond intelligibility because it is not a further domain.
- What is called “possibility” just is the space opened by intelligible distinction.
- There is no residual modal remainder once the conditions of intelligibility are fixed.

## VII. Consequence for Resistance
- Apparent resistance appeals to possibilities that cannot be specified without reintroducing distinction covertly.
- Such resistance presupposes ungrounded modal commitments (brute alternatives, ineffable states, primitive modal space).
- Absent those commitments, resistance collapses into the mere production of tokens without determinate content.

## VIII. Transition Point
- With the identity of intelligibility and possibility established, there is no longer a gap for facts, actuality, or reality to “outrun.”
- Only at this stage can factivity be introduced as a consequence rather than a premise.
- The Minimal Factivity Constraint follows downstream, not as an axiom but as an implication of the collapse of modal space.
