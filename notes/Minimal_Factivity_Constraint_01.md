# Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)

**Plain-language Summary**

For something to count as real in any meaningful sense, it has to *make a difference* to whether it is the case or not. If a supposed fact would be exactly the same whether it obtained or failed to obtain—if nothing would be different even in principle—then there is no genuine fact there at all. Calling such a situation “real” does no work.

The MFC says that reality cannot include facts that are indifferent to their own obtaining. Being the case must amount to something; it cannot be a null operation. This is not about what can be known or said, but about what it is for something to actually be the case rather than merely be named.

In short: **if “being the case” makes no difference, there is nothing there to count as being the case.**

The Minimal Factivity Constraint is not a provable truth but a transcendental constraint on ontological seriousness. Once accepted, it allows metaphysics to bootstrap itself into coherence by fixing the minimal sense in which something must differ from nothing in order to count as existing at all. Rejecting it does not yield an alternative metaphysics, but the collapse of metaphysics into ontological idleness.

That said: The MFC is a proposition--a line in the sand. One may accept or reject it. The point is that rejection has costs, and this document argues why no one should be willing to pay those costs.

## **Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)** Formal Definition.

> *There cannot be a fact whose obtaining makes no difference, even in principle, to whether it obtains rather than does not obtain.*

Equivalently:

> *For something to count as being the case, there must be a minimal distinction between its being the case and its not being the case.*

This principle is **metaphysical**, not semantic or epistemic. It does not concern what can be known, said, or represented. It fixes what counts as *actuality* rather than pseudo-actuality.

## What is a "Difference?" (Distinction-Theoretic)

**Difference** is understood here in the Spencer-Brown sense: not as a relation between two independently given items, but as the **primitive act or condition of distinction** by which determinacy is introduced at all.

### Core Definition

> **Difference** is the obtaining of a distinction such that there is a non-degenerate contrast between an inside and an outside, a marked and an unmarked state, or a being-the-case and a not-being-the-case.

Equivalently:

> A difference exists iff the states *A obtains* and *A does not obtain* are not identical—where “not identical” is taken as primitive and irreducible.

### Clarificatory Constraints

This notion of difference is subject to the following constraints:

1. **Primitive (Non-Reductive)**
   Difference is not analyzed in terms of causation, structure, quantity, explanation, representation, or observation. It is a bedrock contrast required for anything to count as determinate rather than null.

2. **Non-Relational in the Ordinary Sense**
   Difference does not presuppose two independently existing relata. The relata (marked/unmarked, inside/outside) are generated by the distinction itself.

3. **Metaphysical, Not Semantic or Epistemic**
   The distinction is not a matter of language, description, knowledge, or perspective. It concerns what it is for something to be the case rather than not be the case, irrespective of whether that distinction can be expressed or detected.

4. **Minimal and Non-Structural**
   No commitment is made to plurality, discreteness, metric distance, or internal articulation. A single distinction suffices. Anything weaker collapses into indifference.

5. **Contrastive with Respect to Actuality**
   A distinction must differentiate actuality from non-actuality. A purported distinction that leaves the world exactly the same whether it is drawn or not is degenerate and does not count as a difference.

### Exclusion of Degenerate Cases

On this definition, the following do **not** qualify as differences:

* A “fact” whose obtaining is indistinguishable from its non-obtaining.
* A mark that marks nothing; a distinction with no contrast.
* A state of affairs whose actuality does no work beyond what non-actuality already does.

Such cases fail not empirically or epistemically, but **formally**: they do not succeed in drawing a distinction at all.

### Resulting Characterization

Difference, in this sense, is the **minimal condition for facthood**. To be a fact is to stand on one side of a distinction whose other side is not the same. Where no such distinction exists, there is not a different kind of being, but **no being at all**.

This definition supplies the minimal metaphysical content required for the Minimal Factivity Constraint to be non-vacuous while remaining maximally non-committal about the structure of reality beyond the existence of distinction itself.

## Limit of Articulation — Difference as Entry Condition

### 1. Why “difference” cannot be further articulated
The Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) functions as an **entry condition**, not a substantive ontology.  
Any attempt to specify *what kind* of difference (causal, modal, structural, explanatory) immediately
adds internal structure and therefore exceeds the role of a lower-bound constraint.

The pressure to further articulate difference is thus a **category mistake**: it asks for internal
articulation at the level where only admission conditions apply.

**Conclusion:**  
Difference cannot be further specified without proposing a conception of reality.  
This is not a defect but a structural limit.

---

### 2. Difference as a primitive contrast, not a property
Difference is **not**:
- a property possessed by facts,
- a relation between independently given relata,
- a metaphysical ingredient added to reality.

Difference is the **minimal success condition for facthood**.

Formulated negatively:

> If there is no contrast between obtaining and not obtaining, then there is no fact.

The MFC enforces this failure condition rather than offering a positive analysis.

---

### 3. Why “it differs by obtaining” fails as a reply
Appealing to “obtaining” does not generate a difference unless obtaining itself is contrastive.

If “obtaining” introduces no contrast, then invoking it cannot distinguish
being the case from not being the case.

This is a **formal point**:
a term cannot perform contrastive work if it is defined so as to make no difference.

**Therefore:**  
If obtaining is ontologically idle, it cannot ground factivity.

---

### 4. Procedural articulation without metaphysical commitment
The MFC can be stated **procedurally** rather than ontologically:

> A candidate fact fails to qualify as a fact if removing it from the ontology leaves everything
> exactly the same, including actuality itself.

This formulation:
- avoids causation,
- avoids epistemic conditions,
- avoids substantive modality,
- avoids structural commitments.

It enforces exclusion without positing structure.

---

### 5. Why this is not a hidden metaphysics
All metaphysical frameworks rely on primitive contrasts  
(e.g., being / non-being, true / false).

The MFC does not introduce a new primitive.  
It requires that these contrasts **not be empty**.

It refuses to allow “being” to collapse into indifference.

---

### 6. Stopping point
> **Difference is not what metaphysics explains.  
> Difference is what makes metaphysical explanation possible.**

Attempting to go further is not clarification; it is a change of project.

## Constraint Asymmetry

### Core Claim

Metaphysical frameworks may be **more constraining than the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)** and remain coherent, but none can be **less constraining and still be metaphysical**.

The MFC fixes a **lower bound on facthood itself**. Constraints can be added above this bound; relaxing it removes the distinction that gives ontology a subject matter.

---

### Entry Conditions vs. Internal Structure

It is crucial to distinguish two kinds of principles:

**1. Entry Conditions (Lower-Bound Constraints)**  
These determine what can count as a fact or existent at all.
- Minimal Factivity Constraint  
- Requirement of a non-degenerate distinction  

Removing these collapses facthood into indifference.

**2. Internal Organization Principles**  
These presuppose facthood and structure what is already admitted.
- Fundamentality
- Grounding
- Dependence

These do not restrict entry into ontology; they order what is already there.

---

### Substantive Enrichment

Further constraints may be imposed after entry, such as:
- causal efficacy
- law-governedness
- structural articulation

These can exclude candidates while preserving minimal contrast.

---

### Asymmetry Explained

- **More constraint** adds structure while preserving distinction.  
- **Less constraint** eliminates distinction and dissolves metaphysics.

The MFC therefore functions as a **floor on ontological seriousness**, not a substantive theory or optional refinement.

## What Rejecting the MFC Commits One To

Rejecting the MFC commits one to the coherence of **difference-free facthood**. Concretely, it requires accepting all of the following as metaphysically possible:

1. **Facts indistinguishable from their non-obtaining**
   States of affairs that obtain, yet are in no respect different from not obtaining—not even with respect to actuality itself.

2. **Actuality with no contrast to non-actuality**
   Being that does no ontological work beyond what non-being already does.

3. **Ontological idleness**
   A notion of “existence” that places no constraints on what counts as existing and excludes nothing whatsoever.

4. **Collapse of factivity**
   The distinction between:

   * something being the case, and
   * nothing being the case
     is no longer a distinction at all.

This is not merely an epistemic humility position. It is a commitment to **metaphysical vacuity**: a reality in which “what is” and “what is not” play identical roles.

---

## Why These Costs Should Not Be Accepted

### 1. It empties “fact,” “actuality,” and “existence” of their role

The point of invoking facthood or existence in metaphysics is to mark a difference between:

* how reality is, and
* how it is not.

If this contrast is abandoned, the notions of *fact*, *actuality*, and *being* no longer discriminate anything. They cease to function as ontological notions at all.

This is not theoretical minimalism; it is **conceptual abdication**.

---

### 2. It licenses unrestricted pseudo-ontology

Without the MFC, there is no basis for excluding any purported “being,” no matter how inert or vacuous. Every claim of existence becomes equally acceptable, because existence itself imposes no constraint.

Metaphysics becomes incapable of drawing even the weakest line between:

* something being so, and
* nothing being so.

At that point, ontological commitment is indistinguishable from verbal stipulation.

---

### 3. It undermines disagreement about being

If facts can obtain without differing from not obtaining, then no metaphysical disagreement about what exists can amount to more than a difference in labels.

Disputes about being lose their subject matter. Nothing turns on whether one ontology is correct rather than another, because correctness itself no longer tracks anything.

That is not pluralism; it is **ontological collapse**.

---

### 4. It offers no compensating explanatory gain

Rejecting the MFC does not:

* explain obscure phenomena,
* accommodate ineffability,
* secure metaphysical depth,
* or preserve some elusive absolute.

It merely allows one to say that reality might be *absolutely indifferent to being anything at all*.

There is no explanatory payoff commensurate with the cost.

---

## Positive Justification for Accepting the Minimal Factivity Constraint

Accepting the MFC does not impose structure, plurality, discreteness, or articulation on reality. It requires only this:

> *If reality is anything at all, then there must be a distinction between its being the case and its not being the case.*

That requirement is minimal, non-structural, and unavoidable for metaphysics to retain a subject matter.

The principle therefore functions as a **constraint on ontological seriousness**, not as a substantive theory of what exists.

---

## Resulting Position

Once the MFC principle is accepted, the metaphysical thesis follows directly:

* Facthood requires a difference between being the case and not being the case.
* That difference is just minimal distinction.
* Therefore, **to be is to be distinct**.

Rejecting the MFC preserves formal coherence only at the price of rendering “being” idle. Accepting it preserves the minimal contrast required for metaphysics to be about anything at all.

That is the bootstrap point—and it is one metaphysics cannot avoid without dissolving itself.
