# Addendum: Minimal Constraint, Misreadings, and the Non‑Empirical Sense of the Real

## Purpose

This addendum performs three tightly connected tasks:

1. It shows that the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) is the **weakest possible non‑permissive constraint** on being.
2. It diagnoses and blocks the most common **systematic misreadings** of the MFC.
3. It makes explicit that, within this framework, **“real” does not mean “empirical,” causal, observable, or practically accessible**.

The aim is not to extend the theory, but to stabilize it against predictable distortions while preserving its minimality.

## I. Why the MFC Is the Weakest Possible Non‑Permissive Constraint

The MFC does not introduce structure, plurality, causation, lawfulness, or determination. It introduces only a single prohibition:

> There cannot be being that is indifferent, even in principle, to whether it is or is not the case.

This is the **minimal line** separating metaphysics as a theory of actuality from metaphysics as a space of permissibility.

Any weaker constraint would fail to exclude at least one of the following:

* facts indistinguishable from their non‑obtaining,
* existence claims that rule nothing out,
* ontologies in which nothing turns on whether anything exists.

Once these are permitted, the concept of being ceases to mark actuality at all. “Exists” becomes a vacuous label rather than a discriminating notion.

The MFC therefore does not *add* content to being; it merely prevents being from collapsing into **ontological idleness**. Any further weakening would no longer constrain anything.

In this sense, the MFC is not a strong metaphysical thesis but the **last possible constraint before metaphysics dissolves into permissibility**.

## II. Common Misreadings of the MFC (and Why They Fail)

### 1. The Epistemic Misreading

**Misreading:** The MFC requires that existence be knowable, detectable, or evidentially accessible.

**Correction:** The MFC is indifferent to knowledge. It places no requirements on what can be known, justified, observed, or proven. A fact may satisfy the MFC even if no subject could ever discover it.

What matters is not epistemic access, but whether reality is one way rather than another.

---

### 2. The Causal Misreading

**Misreading:** The MFC requires that what exists must have causal effects.

**Correction:** Causation is a substantive metaphysical structure. The MFC is neutral with respect to causation. A causally inert entity or realm may satisfy the MFC so long as its existence is a fact of the matter.

The constraint is on **factivity**, not on interaction.

---

### 3. The Empirical Misreading

**Misreading:** The MFC collapses the real into the empirically observable.

**Correction:** Nothing in the MFC privileges observation, measurement, or empirical testability. Empirical accessibility is a contingent feature of some realities, not a condition of being.

A reality may be:

* empirically inaccessible,
* forever unobservable,
* non‑spatiotemporal,
* entirely outside causal contact,

and still fully real, provided that its existence makes a difference to what is the case.

---

### 4. The Semantic Misreading

**Misreading:** The MFC is merely a claim about how we use the word “exists.”

**Correction:** The MFC is not a linguistic rule but a constraint on facthood. It does not legislate usage; it diagnoses when a purported ontological commitment has failed to secure a referent.

The problem it identifies is not misuse of language, but **absence of actuality**.

---

## III. “Real” Does Not Mean “Empirical”

Within this framework, the term “real” is deliberately thin.

To say that something is real is to say only this:

> It is the case that it exists rather than not.

Nothing further follows.

In particular, “real” does **not** mean:

* empirically observable,
* causally efficacious,
* measurable,
* testable,
* practically relevant,
* cognitively accessible,
* or integrated into human inquiry.

These are additional predicates, not conditions of reality.

This is why the MFC is compatible with:

* radically inaccessible domains,
* non‑causal structures,
* isolated worlds,
* abstract or non‑spatiotemporal realities,
* entities that make no difference to us.

What it is *not* compatible with is a purported reality that makes **no difference at all**, even to itself.

---

## IV. Why This Clarification Matters Dialectically

Many objections to the MFC trade on a tacit conflation:

* between **being real** and **being empirically serious**, or
* between **factivity** and **practical relevance**.

Once this conflation is removed, the dialectical terrain shifts.

The choice is no longer between:

* empirical reductionism, and
* metaphysical permissiveness.

It is between:

* a metaphysics that answers to actuality in the thinnest possible sense, and
* a metaphysics that allows existence claims to float free of any difference between being and non‑being.

The MFC occupies the former position without importing any further structure.

---

## V. Restatement of the Result

With these clarifications in place, the role of the MFC can be stated precisely:

* It is the weakest possible constraint that still allows “exists” to refer.
* It excludes only difference‑free being, not strange or inaccessible realities.
* It does not reduce reality to the empirical, causal, or observable.
* It functions as a condition on actuality, not on language or knowledge.

Anything that exists may be as bizarre, remote, ineffable, or alien as one likes.

It must only be the case that it exists.

Nothing more is demanded—and nothing less will do.
