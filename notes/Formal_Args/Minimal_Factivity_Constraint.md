# Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)

## Plain-Language Summary

If there is to be such a thing as *being*, then being must be determinately fixed rather than indifferent. For something to count as real in any ontologically serious sense, its being the case must *make a difference* relative to its not being the case. If a purported fact would leave reality exactly the same whether it obtained or failed to obtain—if no determination would differ even in principle—then nothing is determined as being the case.

The Minimal Factivity Constraint makes explicit a constitutive requirement on being itself. It states that reality cannot include facts—or actuality more generally—that are indifferent to their own obtaining. Being the case cannot be a null operation. This is not a thesis about language, knowledge, representation, or pragmatic usefulness, but about what must be in place for anything to *count as being* at all.

In short:

> **If being the case makes no difference from not being the case, then being is indeterminate.**

The MFC is not a provable doctrine and not a merely optional methodological rule. It articulates the minimal condition under which anything can count as being. To reject it is not to adopt a rival conception of being, but to abandon determinacy with respect to being altogether.

## Formal Statement

> **Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC):**  
> For something to count as being at all, there must be a minimal distinction between its being the case and its not being the case.

The MFC is **metaphysical** in scope. It does not regulate how we speak or what we can know; it fixes a condition on what can count as actuality.

## Difference as the Condition of Being

### Core Notion

**Difference** is understood in a strictly minimal, distinction-theoretic sense: not as a relation between independently given items, but as the constitutive condition under which determinacy is introduced at all.

> A difference exists iff the states *A obtains* and *A does not obtain* are not identical—where “not identical” is primitive and irreducible.

This contrast is not an added feature of being. It is what makes determinacy possible in the first place.

### Constraints on Difference

1. **Primitive and Non-Reductive**  
   Difference is not analyzed in terms of causation, structure, explanation, modality, representation, or observation. It is the minimal condition under which anything can count as determinate rather than idle.

2. **Non-Relational**  
   Difference does not presuppose two independently existing relata. The distinction between obtaining and not obtaining is generated by the contrast itself.

3. **Metaphysical, Not Semantic or Epistemic**  
   The distinction concerns actuality and its determination, not descriptions, beliefs, or perspectives.

4. **Minimal and Non-Structural**  
   No commitment is made to plurality, discreteness, metric distance, or internal articulation. A single contrast suffices. Anything weaker fails to secure determinacy.

5. **Contrastive with Respect to Being**  
   A purported distinction that leaves being exactly the same whether drawn or not does not succeed in determining being.

### Degenerate Non-Cases

The following do not qualify as difference in the relevant sense:

- A “fact” indistinguishable from its non-obtaining.  
- A mark that fails to mark anything.  
- An actuality whose being introduces no determination.

Such cases fail formally, not empirically: they do not succeed in determining anything as being.

## Difference as an Entry Condition on Being

The MFC functions as an **entry condition on being itself**, not merely on fact-talk and not as a substantive ontology.

### 1. Limit of Articulation

Any attempt to specify *what kind* of difference (causal, modal, structural) exceeds the role of a minimal condition. Such specifications belong to substantive metaphysical theories that already presuppose being. The MFC operates prior to them.

### 2. Not a Property or Ingredient

Difference is not a property possessed by beings, nor a metaphysical ingredient added to reality. It is the minimal success condition for anything to count as being:

> **If there is no contrast between obtaining and not obtaining, then being is indeterminate.**

### 3. Why “It Differs by Obtaining” Fails

Appealing to “obtaining” does no work unless obtaining itself introduces contrast. If obtaining fixes nothing, it cannot ground being. An ontologically idle notion cannot determine actuality.

### 4. Procedural Formulation

The MFC can be stated procedurally:

> A candidate for being fails if positing or removing it leaves being wholly undetermined.

This formulation enforces exclusion without presupposing causation, modality, epistemic access, or structure.

### 5. Not a Hidden Metaphysics

All metaphysical frameworks already rely on determinacy at the level of being. The MFC does not add a new primitive; it requires that this determinacy not be empty.

### 6. Stopping Point

> **Difference is not what metaphysics explains.  
> Difference is what makes being determinable at all.**

---

## Constraint Asymmetry

### Lower Bound on Being

Metaphysical frameworks may impose **more** constraints on being and remain coherent. But any framework that imposes **less**—that allows being to be indifferent to its own determination—fails to determine being at all.

The MFC fixes a lower bound not on theory choice, but on being as such.

### Entry Conditions vs. Internal Structure

- **Entry Conditions:**  
  What must be in place for anything to count as being at all (minimal distinction).

- **Internal Organization Principles:**  
  Ways of structuring or explaining what already counts as being (grounding, dependence, fundamentality).

Removing entry conditions yields indeterminacy; adding internal structure does not.

---

## Consequences of Rejecting the MFC

Rejecting the MFC is logically coherent, but its consequence is precise:

- Being ceases to be determinately fixed.  
- “Actuality,” “existence,” and “fact” no longer determine anything.  
- No candidate for being is determinately identified or referentially fixed.

This is not an alternative ontology. It is the absence of any determinate notion of being.

---

## Why This Is Not Merely a Language Game

The MFC does not legislate how the term “being” must be used. It states a condition that anything must satisfy in order to be *being*. A view on which being introduces no determination does not describe being incorrectly; it fails to determine being at all.

This is a failure of ontological determination, not a violation of linguistic rules.

---

## Positive Justification

Accepting the MFC commits one to nothing beyond this:

> **If anything is to be, it must be determinately distinct.**

No plurality, structure, or articulation is required—only determinacy.

---

## Result

Once the Minimal Factivity Constraint is made fully explicit:

- Being requires determinacy.  
- Determinacy requires minimal distinction.  
- Therefore, **to be is to be distinct**.

Rejecting the MFC does not yield a rival conception of being. It yields no determinate conception of being at all. Accepting it secures the minimal condition under which being has a determinate referent.
