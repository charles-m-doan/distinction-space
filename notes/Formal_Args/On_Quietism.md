# Quietism, Determinacy, and the Minimal Factivity Constraint  
## A Companion Clarification

### Aim and Scope

This document clarifies the relation between the **Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)** and philosophical positions commonly grouped under the heading **quietism**. Its purpose is diagnostic rather than polemical. It does not aim to refute quietism, nor to recruit it. Instead, it explains:

- what quietism typically amounts to in contemporary philosophy,
- why it is often invoked in response to minimal factivity claims,
- and why quietism does not expose a reasoning error in the MFC or its consequences.

The discussion is meta-ontological. It concerns the conditions under which existential discourse functions, not the substantive nature of reality.

## 1. What Quietism Is (and Is Not)

Quietism is not a single doctrine, nor a unified school. It is best understood as a **methodological stance** that appears locally across different philosophical domains.

In its most relevant forms, quietism involves one or more of the following commitments:

- **Anti-theoretical restraint:**  
  Philosophy should not advance theories about what *grounds*, *explains*, or *makes true* ordinary claims.
- **Refusal of conditions:**  
  Ordinary existential or normative claims are acceptable, but attempts to state their conditions of possibility are misguided.
- **Deflationary orientation:**  
  Concepts like existence, truth, or necessity do not require metaphysical underwriting beyond their role in practice.

Quietism does *not* typically deny that there are facts, that things are the case, or that discourse is determinate. What it resists is the articulation of those features as explicit philosophical conditions.

## 2. Why Quietism Is Often Invoked Against the MFC

The Minimal Factivity Constraint makes explicit a claim about **determinacy**:

> For anything to count as being at all, its being the case must make a difference relative to its not being the case.

From a quietist perspective, this can sound like unnecessary theory-building. The objection is not that the claim is false, but that it is **illegitimate**—that philosophy has overstepped by attempting to say what must obtain for being or discourse to function.

Thus the quietist response is often not:

- “Determinacy is false,”

but rather:

- “Determinacy need not, and should not, be stated as a condition.”

## 3. The Apparent Tension

This creates an apparent conflict:

- The MFC explicitly articulates a minimal condition on being.
- Quietism explicitly refuses to traffic in such conditions.

From the quietist’s point of view, the MFC looks like a metaphysical thesis smuggled in under a minimal or transcendental label. From the MFC’s point of view, quietism looks like a refusal to acknowledge the conditions already operative in ordinary discourse.

This tension is real—but it is not a logical contradiction.

## 4. Why Quietism Does Not Expose an Error in the MFC

The MFC does **not** require quietists to *endorse* it as a theory. It claims something weaker and more structural:

> Any discourse that purports to say that something is or is not the case already relies on a distinction between obtaining and not obtaining.

This is a **transcendental diagnosis**, not a demand for theoretical allegiance.

Quietism remains compatible with the MFC so long as it does not deny that existence or assertion fixes anything at all. A refusal to theorize determinacy is not the same as a denial of determinacy. The MFC targets only the latter.

In other words:

- Quietism may decline to *talk about* minimal factivity.
- But insofar as it makes ordinary existential claims, it operates **within** it.

This is not a misreading of quietism. It is an account of what quietist practice presupposes in use, regardless of what it disavows in theory.

## 5. Why Quietism Can Feel Like “Not Having an Opinion”

Quietism often strikes critics as evasive or empty, and this reaction has a structural basis.

Quietist positions are typically **asymmetric**:

- They freely criticize metaphysical explanations.
- They diagnose others as confused or overreaching.
- But they refuse to state positive commitments at the same level.

This asymmetry allows quietism to enjoy the benefits of determinacy—stable truth, meaningful negation, settled practice—while declining responsibility for the conditions that make those benefits possible.

The resulting stance can appear less like a neutral position and more like a principled withdrawal from commitment.

## 6. The Proper Diagnosis

The disagreement between quietism and the MFC is not a disagreement about facts, nor about logical validity. It is a disagreement about **what counts as philosophical overreach**.

- Quietism treats the articulation of conditions as itself suspect.
- The MFC treats the articulation of minimal conditions as unavoidable once one reflects on what it is to say that something is the case.

This is a methodological divide, not an internal inconsistency in the MFC.

Quietism does not refute the MFC. At most, it refuses to engage at the level where the MFC operates.

## 7. Conclusion

Quietism is neither a decisive objection to the Minimal Factivity Constraint nor a mere confusion. It is a stance that stabilizes discourse while declining to acknowledge the conditions that stabilize it.

The MFC does not need to defeat quietism. It only needs to show that quietism cannot undercut it. And it does so by making explicit what quietist practice already presupposes:

> That being is not indifferent to its own determination.

Quietism may remain silent about this condition.  
The MFC explains why that silence is possible—and why it does not constitute an alternative.
