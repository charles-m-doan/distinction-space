# Distinction, Inevitability, and the Maximal Extent of Reality

## 1. Core Thesis

**To be is to be distinct.**

Existence consists in there being a fact of the matter: reality being one way rather than not being that way. This minimal contrast between being the case and not being the case is what distinction amounts to. Where no such distinction obtains, nothing is the case, and therefore nothing exists. Absolute indistinction is not a thin or ineffable mode of being, but the absence of being altogether.

Distinction is not an added feature of existence, nor a structure imposed upon it. It is the minimal factive condition without which existence itself does not obtain.

## 2. Distinction as the Irreducible Condition of Facthood

Distinction is not:

- an entity,
- a property,
- a relation,
- a structure,
- or a member of an ontological base.

It is the minimal condition under which anything can count as being the case at all. Distinction does not belong to ontology; it is what makes ontology possible. Its primitiveness is therefore not compositional or structural, but **factive**: it cannot be derived, grounded, or replaced, because any such operation already presupposes contrast.

## 3. Facthood Exhausts Existence

If to be is to be distinct, then:

- existence is exhausted by facthood,
- facthood is exhausted by the distinction between being the case and not being the case,
- there is no deeper metaphysical substrate beneath actuality.

Any attempt to posit a deeper ground—substance, absolute, ground of grounds—either reintroduces distinction (and thus is not deeper) or eliminates it (and thus eliminates being). Existence has no metaphysical depth beyond the fact that something is the case.

## 4. Consequence: No Fundamental Ontology

From this it follows that **no ontology is fundamental**.

A fundamental ontology would have to ground existence itself. But existence has no ground beyond factive distinction, and distinction is not ontological in kind. Ontology therefore always presupposes the condition that makes ontology possible.

Ontologies may differ, compete, and succeed or fail relative to what is the case, but none can claim ultimate priority. Ontology is necessarily downstream.

Ontology does not fail.  
It reaches its limit.

## 5. Why Metaphysics Cannot Explain Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing

Metaphysics cannot explain why there is something rather than nothing, because that “why” already presupposes there being something to explain.

Explanation is itself contrastive: it distinguishes explanans from explanandum, success from failure, sense from non-sense. To ask why there is something already assumes the minimal factive condition whose denial would dissolve the question.

The traditional question therefore does not point to a deeper mystery beneath being. It presupposes the very condition that makes questioning possible at all.

## 6. The Incoherence of “Nothing”

“Nothing” is not a coherent alternative to existence.

For nothingness to function as an alternative, it would have to be distinguishable from something. But any such distinguishability already reintroduces distinction and therefore facthood. A nothing that can be contrasted with being is no longer nothing in the relevant sense.

Absolute nothingness—understood as the total absence of distinction—is not a possible condition of reality. It is the collapse of the conditions under which possibility, actuality, or contrast could apply at all.

Where no distinction obtains, there is not “nothing”; there is no sense in which anything could be said to obtain or fail to obtain.

---

## 7. The Inevitability of Existence

Because “nothing” is not a coherent alternative, existence is not contingent upon a further metaphysical selection. There is no contrastive space in which reality could either be or not be in an absolute sense.

Existence is inevitable not because it is necessary in a modal or logical sense, nor because it is guaranteed by a law or principle, but because the absence of existence would amount to the absence of facthood itself—and with it, the absence of any intelligible alternative.

Being does not prevail over nothing.  
There is no contest.

## 8. The Extent of Reality: Maximality Without Boundaries

If existence is exhausted by facthood, and facthood requires distinction, then **reality cannot have an absolute boundary or outside**.

For reality to have a limit, there would have to be:

- reality up to a boundary, and  
- something beyond it—whether being or nothing.

If what lies beyond is something, then it is distinct, factual, and therefore real after all.  
If what lies beyond is nothing, then there is no fact of the matter there for reality to be bounded against.

In neither case does an absolute limit survive.

Reality is therefore not one domain among others, not a region set against a wider metaphysical background. It does not occupy a container or leave an external remainder.

Reality is **maximal by default**—not by accumulation or completeness, but because there is nowhere else for it to stop.

## 9. Result

The position can be stated concisely:

- **To be is to be distinct.**
- **Distinction is the irreducible condition of facthood.**
- **Facthood exhausts existence.**
- **No ontology is fundamental.**
- **“Nothing” is not a coherent alternative.**
- **Existence is inevitable for lack of an alternative.**
- **Reality has no absolute boundary or outside.**

There is no deeper explanation of why there is something rather than nothing, because explanation presupposes the very fact whose absence it attempts to imagine.

What remains is not a mystery beneath being, but the minimal and unavoidable fact that something is the case rather than not—and that fact admits of no further ground.
