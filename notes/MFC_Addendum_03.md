# Why the Minimal Factivity Constraint Is Not Trivial

## Purpose

This segment addresses a predictable reaction to the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC): that it appears trivial, obvious, or platitudinous. The aim here is to show why this appearance is **misleading**, and why the very features that make the MFC seem trivial are what give it genuine philosophical force.

The MFC is not non-trivial because it is complex or informative. It is non-trivial because it functions as a **boundary condition** on metaphysics. Boundary conditions, when correctly formulated, almost always look obvious.

## 1. The Sense in Which the MFC *Is* Trivial

Stated in its thinnest form, the MFC says something like:

> If something exists, then it is the case that it exists rather than not.

Or equivalently:

> There cannot be a fact whose obtaining makes no difference to whether it obtains.

Taken at face value, this can sound like a restatement of common sense, or even a tautology. Few readers will feel an immediate impulse to deny it. In this limited sense, the MFC *is* trivial: it articulates something that is already implicitly assumed in ordinary talk about existence.

But this triviality is exactly what allows the MFC to do its work.

## 2. Why Minimal Constraints Must Look Trivial

The MFC is not intended to explain reality, describe its structure, or discriminate among competing ontologies. It does none of those things.

Its role is instead to fix the **lowest possible threshold** at which metaphysical discourse still has a subject matter. Constraints operating at this level must be minimal, or they would already prejudge substantive questions.

Any constraint weaker than the MFC would fail to rule out at least one of the following:

* existence claims that exclude nothing,
* facts indistinguishable from their non-obtaining,
* ontologies in which nothing turns on whether anything exists.

Once such positions are allowed, “exists” no longer marks actuality at all. Metaphysics collapses into permissibility.

A constraint that prevents this collapse cannot help but sound obvious, because it marks the **difference between sense and vacuity**, not between rival theories.

## 3. Triviality Versus Innocuousness

The mistake is to infer from the MFC’s triviality that it is innocuous.

Many principles are trivial in formulation but non-trivial in consequence. The MFC belongs to this class. Its acceptance quietly excludes a wide range of positions that present themselves as substantive metaphysical views but in fact rely on denying factivity while retaining the vocabulary of being.

What the MFC rules out is not exotic ontology, but **difference-free ontology**: views on which reality is said to exist even though nothing is the case.

Such views often trade on the assumption that rejecting all constraints is a way of preserving depth, openness, or humility. The MFC shows instead that rejecting this minimal constraint eliminates the possibility of saying anything about being at all.

## 4. Why the MFC Feels Threatening Despite Its Obviousness

The MFC is rarely resisted because it seems false. It is resisted because it **forces commitments to become explicit**.

Once the MFC is accepted, it becomes illegitimate to say:

* that something exists but makes no difference,
* that being is real but indistinguishable from non-being,
* that reality is affirmed while nothing is the case.

Positions that rely on such formulations are not refuted by the MFC; they are rendered **non-factive**. What collapses is not a theory but the appearance of having made an ontological claim at all.

This can feel like a loss of metaphysical freedom, when in fact it is the loss of metaphysical indiscipline.

## 5. The Diagnostic Function of the MFC

The MFC should be understood as a diagnostic principle rather than a constructive one.

It does not tell us what exists. It tells us when a purported existence claim has failed to secure a referent. It distinguishes between:

* disagreement about how reality is, and
* talk that no longer answers to any difference between being and non-being.

In this respect, the MFC plays the same role that minimal coherence constraints play in logic: they do not enrich discourse, but they determine when discourse has ceased to be about anything at all.

---

## 6. The Right Moral to Draw

The correct conclusion is not that the MFC is uninteresting because it is trivial, but that its triviality marks its **proper level of operation**.

If the MFC were more informative, it would already be a substantive ontology. If it were less informative, it would fail to constrain anything. Its apparent obviousness is therefore not a defect but a guarantee that it is not smuggling in hidden structure.

The MFC is trivial in content and non-trivial in consequence. That combination is precisely what allows it to function as the minimal condition under which metaphysics remains a discourse about actuality rather than a permissive play of concepts.

---

## 7. Restatement

The Minimal Factivity Constraint does not aim to surprise. It aims to **draw a line**.

On one side of the line are disputes about what exists and how reality is structured. On the other side is ontological talk that no longer marks any difference between being and non-being.

That the line is easy to state does not make it unimportant. It makes it unavoidable.

Once seen, it cannot be unseen—and that is why it does so much work while saying so little.
