# Permissibility and Factivity: Structural Pressure Points of the Minimal Factivity Constraint

## Abstract

This document analyzes the internal structure of the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) in order to identify where pressure against it must arise and why such pressure cannot coherently take the form of a direct denial of its formulation. The analysis is not historical, sociological, or comparative. It does not presuppose that the MFC is established, familiar, or previously encountered. Its aim is purely diagnostic: to show how resistance would have to be structured, given what the constraint asserts, and what background commitments such resistance would implicitly involve.

---

## 1. Orientation

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to clarify **where resistance to the Minimal Factivity Constraint would have to enter**, assuming the constraint is taken at face value. The analysis is internal and structural. It does not appeal to patterns of reception, prevailing views, or philosophical consensus.

Nothing here turns on whether the MFC is accepted. The task is to map the points at which opposition would become unavoidable and to explain why those points concern the role of actuality in metaphysics rather than any isolated premise.

---

### 1.2 The Minimal Factivity Constraint (for reference)

For the purposes of this analysis, the Minimal Factivity Constraint is stated as follows:

> There cannot be being that is indifferent, even in principle, to whether it is or is not the case.

Equivalently:

> For something to exist, there must be a difference between its being the case and its not being the case.

This formulation is fixed only to identify the target of analysis. The document does not argue for it, derive it, or assume prior endorsement of it.

---

### 1.3 What Counts as Resistance

Resistance, as understood here, does not mean explicit rejection. It refers to any attempt to preserve ontological discourse while weakening, relocating, or neutralizing the role of factivity imposed by the constraint.

Accordingly, the relevant question is not whether one accepts the sentence expressing the MFC, but whether one accepts the **constraint it places on what it is to make a claim about being at all**.

---

## 2. Where Pressure Against the MFC Must Arise

### 2.1 Why Direct Rejection Is Not the Natural Point of Pressure

To reject the MFC directly would require endorsing the coherence of the following position:

> Reality could be exactly the same whether something exists or does not exist, and this would still count as there being something the case.

Any position that avoids this commitment will not exert pressure on the MFC by denying its statement. Instead, pressure must arise elsewhere—by altering what is meant by *existence*, *metaphysics*, or *being the case*.

---

### 2.2 The Commitment Made Explicit by the Constraint

The MFC makes explicit a commitment that is otherwise easily left unarticulated:

> If metaphysics concerns being at all, then it concerns actuality—what is the case rather than merely what is permitted or entertained.

Once this commitment is made explicit, resistance becomes structurally inevitable. The point of contention is not the wording of the constraint, but whether metaphysics is required to answer to actuality in even this minimal sense.

---

### 2.3 Permissibility as the Alternative

Pressure against the MFC arises precisely where existence is treated as **permissive rather than factive**.

Under a permissive conception:

- to say that something exists is not to say that reality is thereby one way rather than another,
- existence excludes no alternatives,
- ontological claims function as allowable posits rather than commitments about how things are.

The MFC blocks this conception by insisting that existence, if it is to be existence at all, must mark a difference between being and non-being.

---

## 3. Four Structural Strategies for Deflecting the Constraint

Any attempt to resist the MFC without denying its statement must proceed by one of a small number of structural moves. These are not empirical tendencies but logical options.

---

### 3.1 Strategy A: Reclassifying Metaphysics

**Structural move.**  
Metaphysics is redefined so that it is no longer primarily concerned with actuality, but with possibility, permissibility, or conceptual space.

**Effect.**  
Under this reclassification, the MFC is treated as imposing an inappropriate demand. The constraint is not rejected as false, but as irrelevant.

**Point of failure.**  
If metaphysics is no longer answerable to how reality is, then it ceases to be metaphysics in the ontological sense. The MFC treats this move not as an alternative metaphysics, but as a withdrawal from ontological commitment.

---

### 3.2 Strategy B: Formalizing “Exists”

**Structural move.**  
“Exists” is treated as a purely formal marker internal to a theory or system of description, without referential force.

**Effect.**  
Questions about whether existence makes a difference to reality are dismissed as category mistakes.

**Point of failure.**  
Once existence is stripped of referential force, ontological discourse no longer concerns being at all. The MFC blocks this move by treating non-referential existence as a loss of subject matter rather than a gain in precision.

---

### 3.3 Strategy C: Appeals to Ineffability or Non-Differentiation

**Structural move.**  
Reality is characterized as undifferentiated, beyond distinction, or ineffable, such that no determinate contrasts apply.

**Effect.**  
The claim is presented as a positive thesis about reality rather than as a rejection of factivity.

**Point of failure.**  
To assert that reality is ineffable is still to assert that something is the case about reality. The MFC allows such claims only at the cost of reintroducing factivity at the meta-level. What is blocked is the attempt to treat ineffability itself as difference-free being.

---

### 3.4 Strategy D: Vacuous Difference

**Structural move.**  
Difference is acknowledged in name but allowed to do no work: it excludes nothing, constrains nothing, and discriminates nothing.

**Effect.**  
The vocabulary of distinction is preserved while its function is nullified.

**Point of failure.**  
A difference that makes no difference does not satisfy the minimal requirement for facthood. The MFC treats such “difference” as ontologically idle.

---

## 4. The Common Pressure Point

### 4.1 What Unifies These Strategies

These strategies are unified not by confusion, but by a shared aim: to retain the language of actuality while resisting accountability to it.

Each strategy attempts to affirm claims about reality—openness, indeterminacy, unconstrained being—while avoiding the requirement that such claims mark a determinate difference between being and non-being.

---

### 4.2 Why the Pressure Is Structural

What the MFC blocks is not a particular doctrine, but a way of speaking that purports to be ontological while declining factive commitment. The resulting pressure is therefore structural: it concerns what it is to make a claim about being at all.

---

## 5. The Resulting Fork

Once the role of factivity is made explicit, the options are limited:

- accept the MFC, and treat existence as marking actuality in the thinnest possible sense, or
- reject it, and allow ontological discourse to become permissive to the point of vacuity.

There is no stable position that preserves ontological seriousness while abandoning the distinction between being the case and not being the case altogether.

---

## 6. Stabilization: Minimality, Misreadings, and Triviality

### 6.1 The Minimality of the Constraint

The MFC introduces no structure, plurality, causation, lawfulness, or determination. It introduces only a prohibition against difference-free being. Any weaker constraint would permit facts indistinguishable from their non-obtaining and would allow “exists” to cease marking actuality altogether.

In this sense, the MFC is the weakest possible constraint that still preserves metaphysics as discourse about being.

---

### 6.2 Misreadings Excluded

The constraint does **not** require:

- epistemic accessibility,
- causal efficacy,
- empirical observability,
- or semantic regulation.

A reality may be inaccessible, causally inert, or entirely outside inquiry and still satisfy the MFC, provided that its existence is a fact of the matter.

---

### 6.3 Triviality and Force

Stated minimally, the MFC can sound obvious:

> If something exists, then it is the case that it exists rather than not.

This apparent triviality is precisely what allows the constraint to function at the correct level. Boundary conditions on sense are not informative; they are exclusionary.

---

### 6.4 Diagnostic Role

The MFC does not specify what exists. It specifies when purported existence claims fail to secure any difference between being and non-being. In doing so, it marks the boundary between disagreement about reality and discourse that has ceased to have a subject matter.

---

## 7. Closing Restatement

The Minimal Factivity Constraint is not presented here as an established principle or shared assumption. It is introduced as an explicit boundary condition on ontological discourse.

Its function is not to resolve metaphysical disputes, but to determine when such disputes are still about anything at all. Once that boundary is drawn, further disagreement can proceed—but only on the side where being is still required to make a difference to whether it is the case.
