# Permissibility and Factivity: Where Resistance to the Minimal Factivity Constraint Arises

## Abstract

This document isolates the points at which resistance to the Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) arises and explains why such resistance rarely appears as a direct denial of its core claim. The analysis does not re-argue for the MFC, nor does it situate it within a historical tradition. Instead, it diagnoses a structural divide concerning what metaphysics is taken to be doing: whether it is answerable to actuality or functions as a permissive space of allowable posits. The central claim is that disagreement over the MFC is methodological and structural rather than local or premise-based.

## 1. Orientation

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to clarify **where genuine disagreement about the Minimal Factivity Constraint arises**, and why such disagreement typically does not take the form of rejecting the constraint as stated. The analysis remains internal to the present framework and draws only on distinctions already in use. No appeal is made to historical authorities, schools, or external examples.

The aim is diagnostic rather than constructive. The question is not whether the MFC is true, but **why resistance to it takes the forms it does**, and what those forms reveal about background commitments concerning metaphysics itself.

---

### 1.2 The MFC (for reference)

For the purposes of diagnosis, the Minimal Factivity Constraint may be stated as follows:

> There cannot be being that is indifferent, even in principle, to whether it is or is not the case.

Equivalently:

> For something to exist, there must be a difference between its being the case and its not being the case.

This formulation is assumed only to fix the target of disagreement. The present document does not defend it or derive consequences from it beyond those needed to locate points of resistance.

### 1.3 What Counts as Disagreement

Disagreement with the MFC rarely presents itself as a straightforward rejection of this formulation. Instead, it typically appears as:

- a reinterpretation of what “exists” is taken to mean,
- a reclassification of what metaphysics is taken to concern,
- or a weakening of the role that actuality is allowed to play.

As a result, the apparent surface agreement masks a deeper divide. The disagreement is not primarily over a sentence, but over **the constraints under which ontological claims are permitted to function as claims about reality at all**.

---

## 2. Where Disagreement Actually Enters

### 2.1 Why Direct Denial Is Rare

Very few positions explicitly endorse the claim that reality could be exactly the same whether something exists or does not exist while still counting as there being something the case. As a result, direct denial of the MFC is uncommon.

Resistance therefore tends to be indirect. It manifests as attempts to preserve the vocabulary of existence while loosening or removing its connection to actuality. The MFC becomes controversial not because its statement is rejected, but because of **what it rules out**.

---

### 2.2 The Core Commitment Made Explicit

The MFC makes explicit a commitment that many metaphysical positions leave unarticulated:

> Metaphysics, if it concerns being at all, concerns actuality—what is the case rather than merely what is permitted, conceivable, or not ruled out.

Once this commitment is brought to the foreground, disagreement becomes unavoidable. The point of contention is not the MFC’s formulation, but whether metaphysics should be constrained by actuality in even this minimal sense.

---

### 2.3 Permissibility as the Hidden Alternative

Positions that resist the MFC typically operate with a **permissive conception of existence**. Under this conception:

- to say that something exists is not to say that reality is thereby one way rather than another,
- existence excludes no alternatives,
- and ontological claims function as allowable posits rather than as factive commitments.

Such positions rarely announce themselves as permissive. They retain the language of being while quietly severing it from any requirement to make a difference to what is the case. The MFC directly blocks this move.

---

## 3. Four Recurrent Strategies of Resistance

Resistance to the MFC tends to cluster around four recurring strategies. Each avoids direct denial by relocating or neutralizing the constraint imposed by factivity.

---

### 3.1 Strategy A: Reclassifying Metaphysics

**What it asserts.**  
Metaphysics is taken to concern possibility, permissibility, or conceptual space rather than actuality.

**Why it avoids direct denial.**  
On this view, the MFC is not false but misplaced. It is seen as imposing an illegitimate demand on an enterprise not intended to describe how reality is.

**Point of conflict.**  
The disagreement concerns whether metaphysics remains metaphysics once it ceases to answer to actuality at all. The MFC rejects the reclassification by treating it as an abandonment of subject matter rather than a refinement of method.

---

### 3.2 Strategy B: Formalizing “Exists”

**What it asserts.**  
“Exists” is treated as a purely formal or intra-theoretic marker, playing a role within a system of inference without referential burden.

**Why it avoids direct denial.**  
If existence is not intended to refer, then questions about its making a difference to reality are dismissed as category mistakes.

**Point of conflict.**  
The MFC insists that once existence is stripped of referential force, metaphysics has not become more precise but has ceased to be about anything at all. The disagreement is over whether non-referential “existence” can still ground ontological seriousness.

---

### 3.3 Strategy C: Appeals to Ineffability or Non-Duality

**What it asserts.**  
Reality is said to be undifferentiated, beyond distinction, or ineffable, such that no determinate contrast applies.

**Why it avoids direct denial.**  
The claim is presented as a positive thesis about reality rather than as a rejection of factivity.

**Point of conflict.**  
The MFC does not deny the intelligibility of limit claims. It denies only that such claims can function as assertions about being without reintroducing factivity at the meta-level. To say that reality is ineffable is still to say that something is the case.

---

### 3.4 Strategy D: Vacuous Difference

**What it asserts.**  
Existence involves “difference,” but the difference need not exclude, constrain, or discriminate anything.

**Why it avoids direct denial.**  
By retaining the vocabulary of difference, the appearance of compliance with the MFC is preserved.

**Point of conflict.**  
The MFC treats difference that makes no difference as ontologically idle. This is not a semantic stipulation but a constraint on what can count as facthood at all.

---

## 4. The Motivational Pressure Point

### 4.1 What Unifies the Strategies

These strategies are not unified by confusion or error. They are unified by **attachment** to claims taken to be genuinely about reality:

- that reality is radically open,
- that it exceeds all determination,
- that it cannot be constrained.

Each is taken to be something that is the case. The resistance arises from attempting to affirm actuality while resisting accountability to it.

---

### 4.2 Why the Attachment Matters

The MFC blocks the possibility of asserting actuality without constraint. What collapses under the MFC is not a particular theory, but the appearance of having made an ontological claim while avoiding factive commitment.

---

## 5. Structural Upshot

### 5.1 Why the Dispute Is Structural

The disagreement over the MFC is not about a premise or an inference. It is about whether metaphysics should tolerate existence claims that make no difference to what is the case.

---

### 5.2 The Forced Choice

Once the issue is faced directly, the options are limited:

- accept the MFC, and treat existence as marking actuality, or
- reject it, and allow metaphysics to become permissive to the point of vacuity.

There is no stable intermediate position that preserves ontological seriousness while abandoning factivity altogether.

---

## 6. Stabilization: Minimality, Misreadings, and the Force of Triviality

### 6.1 The Minimality of the Constraint

The MFC introduces no structure, plurality, causation, lawfulness, or determination. It introduces only a prohibition against difference-free being. Any weaker constraint would permit facts indistinguishable from their non-obtaining and would allow “exists” to cease marking actuality at all.

In this sense, the MFC is the **weakest possible non-permissive constraint** on being.

---

### 6.2 Systematic Misreadings Blocked

The MFC is frequently misread as imposing requirements it does not impose:

- **Epistemic:** It does not require knowability or evidential access.
- **Causal:** It does not require causal efficacy.
- **Empirical:** It does not privilege observation or measurement.
- **Semantic:** It is not a rule about word use, but a constraint on facthood.

A reality may be inaccessible, causally inert, or entirely outside inquiry and still satisfy the MFC, provided its existence is a fact of the matter.

---

### 6.3 Why the MFC Can Look Trivial

Stated minimally, the MFC can sound obvious:

> If something exists, then it is the case that it exists rather than not.

This apparent triviality is a feature, not a defect. Boundary conditions at the lowest level of sense almost always sound obvious. Their work lies in exclusion rather than information.

---

### 6.4 Triviality Versus Innocuousness

The mistake is to infer from obviousness to harmlessness. The MFC excludes only difference-free being, but that exclusion has wide consequences. It renders certain ways of speaking unavailable—not because they are false, but because they fail to secure a subject matter.

---

### 6.5 The Diagnostic Role of the MFC

The MFC functions diagnostically. It does not tell us what exists. It tells us when purported existence claims have failed to mark any difference between being and non-being. In this respect, it fixes the line between disagreement about reality and discourse that has ceased to be about anything at all.

---

## 7. Closing Restatement

The Minimal Factivity Constraint does not aim to surprise or to compete with substantive ontologies. It fixes the minimal condition under which metaphysical discourse remains answerable to actuality.

That it can sound obvious reflects its level of operation. That it provokes resistance reflects the fact that some positions depend on denying it while continuing to speak as if they had not.

Once made explicit, the MFC does not resolve metaphysical disputes. It determines which disputes still have a subject matter.
