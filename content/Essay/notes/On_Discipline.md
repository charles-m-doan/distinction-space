# On Discipline

Conservatism is not the same thing as intellectual discipline.

Being disciplined does **not** mean preemptively ruling out whole regions of possibility because they feel alien, unintuitive, or impractical. In fact, that kind of a priori exclusion is one of the most reliable ways blind spots survive long enough to harden into “common sense.”

You don’t know what you don’t know. And the fastest way to ensure you never find out is to quietly treat your inherited ontological assumptions as if they were conditions of possibility themselves.

When someone looks at distinction-space and says, *“This is useless—anything can be real under this view!”*, that isn’t rigor. It isn’t even practicality. It’s a refusal to examine which assumptions they were already relying on to restrict possibility in the first place.

Distinction-space is not a license to assert that *everything is real*. It is what remains when you remove all assumptions **except one**: that if something is going to count as anything at all, it has to be intelligible—distinguishable from not being the case.

If you want to restrict what is possible, that’s perfectly legitimate. But you don’t get to do it for free.

Restrictions belong **downstream**, inside models, theories, and abstraction layers. They do not belong **upstream**, disguised as claims about what reality “must be” or what is “obviously impossible.” If you want to narrow the space, you have to argue for the structures that do the narrowing.

Appeals to “practicality” are fine—as long as they’re owned as practical. They stop being fine the moment they are used to rule out alternative ontological frameworks *in principle*, or to smuggle in claims about what reality really is.

This is why you are not justified in dismissing proposals like Wolfram’s Ruliad, Tegmark’s MUH, Barbour’s Platonia, Barandes’s stochastic processes, or competing interpretations of quantum mechanics simply because they violate your habituated picture.

Familiarity is not a criterion of intelligibility.
Entrenchment is not a metaphysical argument.

Once we’re already operating far outside the Middle World—Hilbert spaces, gauge redundancy, renormalization, effective field theories—intuition has *already* failed. What remains is coherence, constraint, and explanatory role. If alternatives are rejected, they should be rejected on those grounds, not because they feel excessive, extravagant, or unfamiliar.

Discipline does not come from narrowing possibility prematurely.
It comes from being explicit about **where** restriction enters—and refusing to let it masquerade as necessity.
