# Near-Misses at the End of Fundamentality

## Introduction: Why the Question Keeps Reappearing

The suspicion that *nothing ontological can be fundamental* is not new. It recurs across the history of philosophy whenever reflection turns on the limits of explanation, grounding, or metaphysical depth. Again and again, philosophers arrive at positions that *undermine* fundamentality—only to stop short of eliminating it. What remains is a residue: a noumenal domain, a framework-relative ontology, an ineffable remainder, or a privileged explanatory base quietly reinstated under another name.

This essay surveys several of the most influential of these **near-misses**. Each identifies a genuine pressure against fundamental ontology. Each diagnoses real failures in traditional metaphysics. And each ultimately fails for a structurally similar reason: none fixes **constitutive conditions of admissibility** that apply *without exception*, including to themselves. What they provide are critiques, deflations, or relocations of fundamentality—not its dissolution.

The contrast with the Distinction Constraint (DC) is not one of ambition or scope, but of **where constraint is located**. Earlier attempts place limits epistemically, linguistically, methodologically, or pragmatically. DC places the limit **constitutively**, at the level of what it is to make ontological claims at all. That difference is decisive.

## 1. Kant: The Epistemic Limit That Leaves Being Intact

Kant is often the first figure invoked when metaphysical ambition is curtailed. His critical philosophy shows that claims about the ultimate nature of reality—*things in themselves*—cannot be justified using the categories that structure experience. Space, time, causality, and substance apply only within the conditions of possible experience. Metaphysics that exceeds those conditions collapses into illusion.

This is a powerful restriction. It blocks dogmatic metaphysics and reveals the dependence of ontological claims on conditions of cognition. Yet Kant’s restriction is **epistemic**, not constitutive. He does not deny that noumenal reality exists or could be fundamental; he denies that *we can know it*. Fundamentality is preserved as a coherent notion, merely inaccessible.

What is lacking here is closure. The idea of a reality that underwrites appearances but lies beyond all application conditions is left standing. The very move that secures humility—distinguishing phenomena from noumena—also preserves a form of fundamentality insulated from critique. The limit is placed on *us*, not on the intelligibility of ontological claims themselves.

DC supplies what Kant withholds: the step from "we cannot know X" to "claims about X lack conditions of application." The latter does not fence off a mysterious remainder; it dissolves it.

## 2. Carnap: Framework-Relativity Without Non-Optional Constraint

Carnap’s critique of metaphysics proceeds by distinguishing *internal* from *external* questions. Within a linguistic framework, ontological questions are meaningful and answerable. Outside any framework, questions about what “really exists” are pseudo-questions—expressions of preference rather than cognition.

This move is structurally close to treating ontologies as abstraction layers. Carnap correctly identifies that existence claims are not made from nowhere, and that disputes about ultimate reality often mask disagreements about linguistic or conceptual choices.

But Carnap’s solution renders framework adoption **conventional**. One may choose a framework for pragmatic reasons, but no framework is constitutively required. As a result, ontological commitment becomes optional, and metaphysical quietism replaces elimination. Fundamentality is not shown to be incoherent; it is merely redescribed as a misguided question outside a framework.

What is missing is non-optionality. Carnap never argues that *any* meaningful ontological claim must satisfy shared conditions of admissibility. He allows a plurality of frameworks without fixing what it is to make a claim at all. DC rejects that permissiveness: admissibility is not a convention one adopts, but a condition already in force whenever one asserts, denies, or explains anything.

## 3. Wittgenstein: Dissolution Without Closure

Later Wittgenstein famously dissolves philosophical problems by attending to the grammar of our language. Metaphysical confusion arises, he argues, when words are torn from their ordinary use and pressed into inappropriate roles. Many traditional ontological claims do not state facts but express pictures that mislead us.

This diagnosis correctly targets pseudo-depth. It explains why metaphysical debate often persists without resolution. However, Wittgenstein refuses to systematize these insights into general constraints. His method is therapeutic and case-based. He shows *this* confusion dissolving, or *that* temptation arising—but he does not articulate global conditions under which ontological discourse is admissible.

As a result, fundamentality is undermined piecemeal but never ruled out in principle. One can always claim that some metaphysical picture has not yet been therapeutically examined. The space never closes.

DC takes the step Wittgenstein avoids: it states explicit constitutive constraints and applies them without exception. Where Wittgenstein dissolves individual illusions, DC explains why the illusion of fundamentality is structurally inevitable—and why it cannot be redeemed.

## 4. Heidegger: Rejection of Ontic Fundamentality via a New Quasi-Fundamental

Heidegger rejects traditional metaphysics for forgetting the question of Being. Entities (the ontic) are not fundamental; the conditions under which beings can appear as beings (the ontological) are prior. This seems, at first glance, like a denial of fundamental ontology.

But the denial is only partial. Being itself becomes privileged. It is said to withdraw, to exceed determination, to resist conceptual capture. In practice, it functions as a new kind of fundamentality—one explicitly insulated from ordinary conditions of application.

What is lacking is constraint. Heidegger refuses to specify application conditions for talk of Being, treating indeterminacy as profundity rather than as loss of sense. The result is not elimination of fundamentality, but its transfiguration into something ineffable and immune.

DC blocks this move directly. Indeterminacy is not depth; it is inadmissibility. Any purported fundamentality that exempts itself from distinction thereby removes the conditions under which “fundamental” could apply.

## 5. Quine: Naturalized Ontology and Relocated Fundamentality

Quine rejects first philosophy and dissolves the analytic–synthetic distinction. Ontological commitment is settled by what our best scientific theories quantify over. There is no standpoint outside science from which to legislate what exists.

This undercuts a priori metaphysics, but it does not eliminate fundamentality. It relocates it. Physics (or whatever science ultimately succeeds) becomes the de facto arbiter of what is basic. Fundamentality is empirical rather than philosophical, but it remains intact as a coherent aim.

What is missing is a constitutive check on ontological predicates themselves. Quine assumes that existential commitment within theory is unproblematic. DC asks the prior question: what must be in place for *any* existential commitment to be determinate at all? Once that question is fixed, no empirical theory can inherit foundational privilege.

---

## 6. Structural Realism: Thinner Primitives, Same Problem

Structural realism denies that objects are fundamental and instead privileges structure or relations. This appears to escape traditional ontology by thinning the inventory of what exists.

But thinning is not elimination. Structure is still treated as ontologically basic. No argument is given that structure itself cannot be fundamental. The problem is merely displaced.

DC’s result is orthogonal to this move. It does not argue that objects or structures are the wrong primitives. It argues that **no ontological primitive—objectual or structural—can coherently claim fundamentality**, because any such claim presupposes distinction-governed application conditions it cannot underwrite.

## 7. The Distinction Constraint: Constitutive Closure Without Remainder

The Distinction Constraint (DC) does not enter this landscape as another metaphysical position, nor as a refinement of any of the views above. Its starting point is neither epistemic limitation, nor linguistic convention, nor methodological caution, but a constitutive observation: **to make any determinate claim at all is to operate under conditions of distinction.**

From this starting point, DC fixes a small set of non-negotiable constraints:

* Ontological predicates such as *exists*, *is*, *possible*, and *fundamental* have application conditions.
* Those conditions are exhausted by distinction-governed contrast: something must count as *this rather than not-this*.
* No claim, framework, or explanatory level is exempt from these constraints, including claims about the conditions themselves.

Once these constraints are made explicit, the notion of fundamental ontology fails in a specific and non-doctrinal way. A purportedly fundamental ontology must, to be ontological at all, be distinguishable, exclusionary, and applicable. But fundamentality is invoked precisely to deny dependence on contrast, conditions, or further articulation. The attempt to make something ontologically fundamental therefore removes the very conditions under which “ontological” and “fundamental” could apply.

The result is not a rejection of fundamentality as false, implausible, or explanatorily idle. It is a demonstration that **fundamentality is an inadmissible use of ontological vocabulary**. Ontology survives only as abstraction: as layer-relative, purpose-bound coarse-graining within an already admissible space. No ontology can coherently claim to be foundational, because foundational status itself has no application conditions once distinction is made explicit.

In this way, DC closes the space that earlier approaches leave open. There is no noumenal remainder, no optional framework choice, no ineffable depth, no scientific base level, and no thinner primitive waiting to inherit the role of foundation. What remains is not impoverishment, but sufficiency: a closed admissible space within which structure, explanation, and ontology can proceed without appeal to illegitimate depth.

If one aims to make determinate, exclusionary, answerable claims about reality, then one is already operating within the admissibility constraints DC articulates—whether one recognizes this or not. Within that space, moves are either licit or illicit. Outside that space, one may still gesture, express, or remain silent—but one is no longer making claims of anything determinate about reality. There is no coherent intermediate position.

## Conclusion: What the Near-Misses Share—and What They Lack

All of these positions identify real pressures against fundamental ontology:

* Kant shows that metaphysical claims outrun justification.
* Carnap shows that ontology is framework-bound.
* Wittgenstein shows that metaphysical depth is often grammatical illusion.
* Heidegger shows that ontic grounding is not ultimate.
* Quine shows that first philosophy fails.
* Structural realism shows that objects are dispensable.

What none of them do is **close the space**. Each leaves room for a remainder: noumenal being, optional frameworks, ineffable depth, scientific privilege, or thinner primitives.

The Distinction Constraint supplies the missing piece by relocating the limit. It does not ask *what exists* or *what grounds what*. It fixes what it is to make such claims at all. Once that constitutive constraint is made explicit and applied reflexively, fundamentality does not lose an argument—it loses its application conditions.

That is why the conclusion is not that fundamental ontology is false, implausible, or unnecessary, but that it is **inadmissible**. And that is precisely what the earlier near-misses never quite say.
