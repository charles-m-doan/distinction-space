# Goals of the Distinction Constraint (DC)

## 1. Establish Distinction as the Sole Primitive

The DC aims to show that **distinction** is the only admissible primitive: not an entity, substance, or fundamental ontology, but the minimal condition under which anything can count as something at all.

## 2. Deny the Coherence of Fundamental Ontology

The DC rejects the idea of a “fundamental ontology.” Ontology is not foundational but **derivative**—it operates only once distinctions are already in place. Any attempt to treat entities, substrates, or grounds as prior to distinction is unintelligible.

## 3. Exhaust Reality Without Surplus

Reality is identified with the **exhaustion of what can count as something at all under admissible distinction**, together with the patterns such distinctions admit. The goal is to show that there is no intelligible remainder, substrate, or ontological excess beyond this exhaustion.

## 4. Show Sufficiency Without Additional Assumptions

A central aim of the DC is to demonstrate that distinction alone—together with the structural constraints implicit in admissible distinction—is sufficient to recover the kinds of structure ordinarily attributed to the world, without introducing further primitives or metaphysical commitments.

## 5. Treat Structure as Derivative, Not Fundamental

Spacetime, causality, lawlikeness, persistence, modality, and explanation are to be shown as **stable, derivative patterns of distinction**, not as fundamental features requiring separate grounding.

## 6. Replace Metaphysical Explanation With Structural Derivation

Rather than accounting for reality by appeal to underlying “stuff,” the DC seeks to **derive familiar structural features** from constraints on how distinctions can combine, stabilize, and exclude alternatives.

## 7. Maintain Reflexive Consistency

All claims made within the DC must themselves respect the conditions they articulate. No step may exempt itself from the requirement of intelligibility through distinction.

## 8. Leave the DC Open but Constrained

The aim is not to fix a final theory of everything, but to **constrain the space of admissible theories of reality**, such that any successful account must arise from distinctions and their patterns alone.

## Overall Strategy: Foundations and Implications

The DC is organized around a strict division between **Foundations** and **Implications**. This division is methodological, not rhetorical. Each phase has a distinct task, burden of proof, and standard of success.

### Foundations: Fixing the Conditions of Intelligibility

The Foundations determine the constitutive conditions under which anything can count as something at all. Their role is **exclusive and eliminative**, not explanatory or comparative.

The Foundations do not propose an ontology, a model of reality, or a set of metaphysical primitives. They fix the minimal constraints that any meaningful use of “is,” “exists,” “possible,” or “real” must satisfy. These constraints operate prior to, and independently of, any particular theory about what there is.

The outcome of the Foundations is a **closed admissibility space**:

* What counts as a coherent starting point is fixed.
* Appeals to substrates, grounds, or being prior to distinction are ruled out as unintelligible.
* No residual notion of reality, existence, or possibility remains outside the space of admissible distinction.

Disagreement at the level of the Foundations concerns **coherence**, not empirical adequacy or theoretical preference. A failure at this stage would indicate internal incoherence in the constitutive constraints themselves.

### Implications: Demonstrating Sufficiency

The Implications accept the Foundations as fixed and introduce **no new primitives, assumptions, or ontological commitments**. Their task is constructive but constrained: to determine whether the admissible space fixed by the Foundations is sufficient to recover familiar structural features.

This phase is responsible for demonstrating that:

* Identity, persistence, regularity, modality, explanation, and lawlikeness can be derived as stable patterns of distinction.
* No appeal to hidden substrates, surplus being, or additional metaphysical machinery is required.
* The admissible space fixed by the Foundations is rich enough to support the structures ordinarily attributed to reality.

Where the Foundations rule out incoherent starting points, the Implications test **sufficiency**. A failure at this stage would not reopen foundational questions; it would show that the admissible space fixed by the Foundations is coherent but insufficiently rich to support the intended structural recoveries.

### Division of Labor and Burden

All eliminative work belongs to the Foundations. All reconstructive and demonstrative work belongs to the Implications. Attempts to demand explanation, realization, or grounding during the Foundations mislocate the burden; attempts to introduce new primitives during the Implications violate the constraints already fixed.

Together, the two phases aim to show that:

1. Only distinction is admissible at the foundations.
2. Nothing more is required to account for reality, once “reality” is properly understood.

The success of the DC depends on maintaining this separation without leakage in either direction.
