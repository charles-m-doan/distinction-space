# On The Permissiveness of the Distinction Constraint

*The Distinction Constraint does not add permissiveness; it removes restrictions that were never constitutively justified.*

## I. Two Sources of Restriction

Restrictions on what may exist, occur, or be possible can arise from two fundamentally different sources:

1. **Constitutive constraint** — limits imposed by the conditions under which anything can count as something at all.
2. **Ontological restriction** — limits imposed by a particular theory, model, or abstraction layer.

The Distinction Constraint (DC) recognizes only the first as foundational.

Restrictions of the second kind are admissible only as derivative and revisable.

## II. Constitutive Constraint Does Not Impose Substantive Modal Restrictions

Constitutive constraints fixed by DC concern:

- applicability of predicates,
- exclusion of negation,
- conditions for determinacy,
- and coherence of contrast.

These constraints do not determine *which* entities exist, *which* laws obtain, or *which* worlds are possible.

They determine only what it would be for any such claim to have content.

As a result, constitutive constraint does not impose substantive modal restrictions. It fixes the conditions under which possibility can be meaningfully articulated at all.

## III. Derivative Restrictions and Their Proper Location

Ontological restrictions arise legitimately within abstraction layers.

Examples include:

- constraints imposed by a physical theory,
- limitations introduced by a modeling choice,
- regularities characteristic of a particular regime,
- laws or symmetries posited within an ontology.

Within DC, such restrictions are treated as:

- local,
- conditional,
- and answerable to revision.

They do not propagate into constitutive constraint.

---

## IV. Illicit Restriction Through Promotion

Restriction becomes illicit when derivative constraints are treated as foundational.

This occurs when:

- features of a favored ontology are treated as limits on intelligibility itself,
- modeling convenience is mistaken for necessity,
- theoretical centrality is treated as metaphysical privilege,
- or empirical regularity is promoted to constitutive law.

In such cases, possibility is narrowed without justification.

**The appearance of excessive permissiveness arises only relative to these unearned restrictions.**

---

## V. Permissiveness as Structural Neutrality

DC admits any posit that satisfies minimal admissibility conditions:

- distinguishability from its negation,
- specification of conditions of application,
- and coherence of contrast.

No further filtering is applied at the foundational level.

This neutrality is not indifference. It reflects the refusal to privilege any ontology prior to its articulation as an abstraction layer.

Permissiveness is therefore the default, not an achievement.

---

## VI. Why Restriction Often Feels Mandatory

Restrictions on possibility often feel mandatory because limits internal to particular ontologies are tacitly treated as limits on admissibility itself.

Several recurring patterns produce this effect.

### 1. Formal Centrality Treated as Constitutive

Mathematical or representational frameworks that occupy a central role in successful theories are often treated as metaphysically privileged.

When this occurs:
- features of the formalism are taken to delimit what can exist,
- alternatives are dismissed as unintelligible rather than merely non-canonical,
- and representational convenience is mistaken for constitutive necessity.

The restriction arises not from admissibility, but from elevation of a tool to a foundation.

---

### 2. Empirical Regularity Treated as Modal Exhaustion

Stable regularities within a regime are often promoted to global constraints on possibility.

In such cases:
- what has been observed is treated as what must obtain,
- contingency is mistaken for necessity,
- and the limits of a model are read as limits of reality.

The resulting restriction reflects extrapolation from success, not constitutive constraint.

---

### 3. Ontological Economy Treated as Admissibility

Preferences for simplicity, parsimony, or elegance are often enforced upstream as limits on what may exist.

When this happens:
- economy functions as a gatekeeper rather than a heuristic,
- alternatives are excluded prior to articulation,
- and explanatory taste substitutes for admissibility conditions.

These restrictions arise from methodological norms, not from conditions of intelligibility.

---

### 4. Interpretive Commitments Treated as Non-Optional

In frameworks that admit multiple interpretations, one interpretation is often treated as fixing what the theory is *really* about.

As a result:
- interpretive choices become invisible,
- alternative articulations are treated as deviations,
- and ontological flexibility is mistaken for incoherence.

Restriction enters through suppression of interpretive variance.

---

### 5. Explanatory Termination Treated as Ontological Depth

Stopping points in explanation are often treated as revelations of fundamentality.

In such cases:
- where inquiry halts is taken to mark what is basic,
- resistance to further explanation is mistaken for necessity,
- and epistemic limits are projected onto reality itself.

The restriction reflects exhaustion, not admissibility.

---

### 6. Inherited Ontologies Treated as Default

Ontological frameworks inherited from dominant theories or traditions are often treated as the background against which all alternatives must justify themselves.

When this occurs:
- deviations are burdened asymmetrically,
- possibility is narrowed silently,
- and admissibility is conflated with familiarity.

The sense of mandatory restriction arises from unexamined inheritance.

---

### 7. Removal of Illicit Restriction as Apparent Permissiveness

When these unearned restrictions are removed, the remaining field of admissible possibility appears unusually large.

This appearance does not reflect expansion of possibility, but restoration of neutrality.

The Distinction Constraint does not add permissiveness; it removes restrictions that were never constitutively justified.

---

## VII. Summary

DC does not permit everything.

It admits anything that can be specified without collapse of distinction.

What it refuses to admit are restrictions that:

- lack constitutive justification,
- arise solely from parochial ontology,
- or masquerade as necessary without admissible contrast.

Permissiveness is therefore not a relaxation of standards, but the consequence of locating restriction at the correct level.
