# The Minimal Admissibility Framework (MAF)

## What MAF Is

The Minimal Admissibility Framework (MAF) is a **foundational philosophical project** that fixes the conditions under which anything can count as something at all. Its aim is not to describe an antecedently given reality, nor to constrain access to an independent domain of being, but to determine what *“being,” “existence,” “possibility,” “structure,”* and *“explanation”* can coherently amount to once all illicit surplus has been removed.

The guiding claim of the MAF is that the apparent boundary between *intelligibility* and *being* is an illusion. “Being” does not name a domain that stands apart from intelligibility, nor something that must be reached, approximated, or grounded. Rather, existential vocabulary is exhausted by the conditions under which anything can be intelligible as anything at all. Once those conditions are made explicit, nothing remains for “being” to do.

The project is explicitly structured into two phases: **Foundations** and **Implications**. This division is methodological, not metaphysical. The Foundations are eliminative and constitutive; the Implications are reconstructive and demonstrative. Together, they form a single framework.

At the level of the Foundations, the MAF fixes **distinction** as the sole admissible primitive—not as an entity, operation, or mechanism, but as the constitutive condition under which any claim, predicate, or contrast can apply at all. To assert, deny, or refer is already to operate within a space of distinction. The MAF does not introduce this condition; it makes explicit what is already presupposed by any attempt to say that something is the case.

On this basis, the Foundations:

* Determine which starting points are coherent and which are not.
* Eliminate appeals to substrates, grounds, or “being prior to distinction” as unintelligible rather than false.
* Fix the use of “exists,” “does not exist,” and “might exist” as internal to distinction-governed application conditions.
* Refuse any privileged meta-level exempt from these constraints.

The **Implications** accept these constitutive constraints as fixed and undertake a further task: to determine whether the admissible space they define is sufficient to recover the kinds of structure ordinarily attributed to the world. No new fundamental primitives or ontological commitments are introduced. Identity, persistence, regularity, modality, explanation, and lawlikeness are treated as **stable patterns of distinction**—as consequences of how distinctions can combine, stabilize, recur, and constrain one another.

Within the Implications, **ontologies are explicitly permitted**, but only as **abstraction layers**, not as foundations. An ontology is understood as a coarse-graining of distinction-space: a selected vocabulary of primitives and relations that compress structure for the purposes of modeling, explanation, and practical reasoning. Ontological primitives are justified by their role and adequacy within an abstraction layer, not by claims of metaphysical priority.

The MAF is therefore **constitutive, eliminative, and demonstrative**. It fixes what it is to make claims at all, and then shows how increasingly familiar structure can be recovered without positing deeper foundations, hidden substrates, or surplus being.

## What MAF Is Not

The MAF is **not** a metaphysical theory in the traditional sense. It does not propose a fundamental inventory of entities, substances, properties, or laws. It does not compete with realism, idealism, physicalism, structuralism, or any other “-ism” understood as a claim about what ultimately exists. Those positions presuppose the very notion of “ultimate being” that the MAF dissolves.

It is **not** an empirical project at the foundational level. No observation, experiment, or scientific theory can confirm or disconfirm the Foundations, because empirical practices already presuppose distinction, applicability, and identity. Scientific theories enter only within the Implications, where they function as high-level abstraction layers evaluated by explanatory role rather than by claims of fundamentality.

It is **not** pluralistic about foundations. Positions that violate the constitutive constraints fixed in the Foundations are not alternative metaphysical views within a shared space. They fail to satisfy the conditions under which ontological or existential claims can be made at all.

It is **not** a theory of how distinctions arise, are implemented, or are realized at the foundational level. Any such account would already presuppose distinction and therefore cannot belong there. Accounts of implementation, realization, or dynamics are legitimate only within the Implications, where they operate under constrained abstraction layers and without appeal to fundamental ontology.

It is **not** conceptual engineering or a proposal about how language ought to be used. The constraints articulated are not recommendations or conventions. They are treated as unavoidable conditions of determinacy for any claim purporting to be about anything.

Finally, it is **not** an attempt to gesture toward an ineffable reality beyond what can be said. The MAF denies that there is any coherent sense to “what lies beyond reality” once the conditions for saying anything at all have been made explicit. The appearance of such a “beyond” is a symptom of misapplied existential vocabulary, not a pointer to a deeper domain.

## What Is the Point of MAF?

The point of the MAF is to **make the limits of sense explicit**, and to show that those limits are not impoverishing but sufficient.

More specifically, the aims of the project are:

1. **To eliminate pseudo-ontology**  
   Many persistent debates in philosophy and foundational science rely on terms such as “ground,” “ultimate being,” or “fundamental reality” while stripping away the conditions under which those terms could apply. The MAF shows that such debates do not concern hidden facts about the world, but failures of intelligibility.

2. **To fix where explanation must stop—and how it can legitimately proceed**  
   The MAF identifies the point at which demands for deeper grounding become category errors, while also showing how explanation legitimately re-enters through abstraction layers. Explanation is not rejected; it is re-situated as structural and layer-relative rather than foundational.

3. **To reconceive ontology as abstraction rather than foundation**  
   Ontologies are retained as indispensable tools: coarse-grained vocabularies that make derivation, modeling, and reasoning tractable. What the MAF denies is that any ontology can claim fundamental status. Ontological disagreement becomes a question of grain, scope, and utility, not of access to ultimate being.

4. **To replace metaphysical fundamentality with structural derivability across layers**  
   Instead of asking which ontology is deepest, the MAF asks how structures at one level arise from constraints operative at others. What matters is not reduction to a base ontology, but coherence across abstraction layers within a single admissible space.

5. **To clarify what “reality” can coherently mean**  
   Reality is not identified with an underlying substrate or hidden domain. It is exhausted by what can count as something at all under admissible use of “is.” Appeals to what lies “beyond” this exhaustion do not describe a deeper reality; they attempt to step outside the conditions of sense.

The success of the MAF does not consist in offering a worldview or a final ontology. It consists in showing that **once the conditions of admissibility are made explicit, all ontologies are necessarily non-fundamental**, and that this does not weaken explanation but disciplines it.

The project is therefore not productive in the sense of generating new metaphysical theories. It is **disciplinary**: it determines what philosophy—and, by extension, science—can meaningfully do, how explanatory work is properly organized, and where claims of fundamentality must stop.
