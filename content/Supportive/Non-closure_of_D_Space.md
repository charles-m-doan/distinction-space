## Purpose and Status of This Step

This step clarifies why **distinction-space cannot be identical to any fully specified formal space**, including bitspace, while remaining fully amenable to formal modeling.

The claim established here is **negative and structural**:

> No total, closed, or exhaustively specifiable formal structure can be ontologically identical to distinction-space.

This is **not** because distinction-space is continuous, analog, ineffable, or metaphysically deep. It follows solely from the **constitutive non-closure of admissible distinction**.

Accordingly, this step:

* blocks readings of bitspace as digital ontology,
* licenses bitspace strictly as a model,
* and preserves formal tools without promoting them to foundations.

---

## What This Step Establishes

* That any admissible context of distinction is **non-exhaustible in principle**.
* That attempts to identify distinction-space with a closed formal structure reintroduce illicit closure.
* That bitspace is legitimate only as a **local abstraction**, not as an ontological identity.

## What This Step Blocks

* Digital ontology.
* Claims that distinction-space is a fixed state space.
* Appeals to a total configuration of all distinctions.

## What This Step Does *Not* Claim

* That distinction-space is infinite in a mathematical sense.
* That it is continuous or analog.
* That formal modeling is inadequate.
* That there is an explanatory regress.

## 1. Distinction Is Constitutively Reflexive

Any context in which distinctions are operative is itself a possible object of further distinction. This is not a contingent feature of reflection or cognition; it follows directly from:

* the requirement that applicability conditions be distinguishable,
* and the refusal of any privileged meta-level exempt from that requirement.

As a result, no context of distinction can be **closed under its own description**.

---

## 2. Non-Closure Is Not Regress

The non-closure at issue here is **not** a vicious regress:

* No explanation is required to terminate.
* No grounding demand is left unsatisfied.
* No infinite hierarchy is posited.

Instead, the result is **open-ended admissibility**:

> For any fixed configuration of distinctions, it remains admissible to draw further distinctions about that configuration.

This mirrors the limits on total explanation articulated in I01 and is a direct consequence of F09.

## 3. Why Closed Formal Spaces Fail as Identities

Any formal space that is:

* exhaustively specifiable,
* closed under its own definition,
* or fully characterizable as a total state space,

implicitly claims to fix *all* admissible distinctions relevant to its domain.

But any such fixation:

* becomes itself a distinguishable object,
* thereby reopening the space of admissible distinctions,
* and invalidating the claim of closure.

Thus, no closed formal structure can be identical to distinction-space.

---

## 4. Bitspace as Model, Not Ontology

Bitspace provides a clear illustration of these points.

* It is fully specifiable.
* Its degrees of freedom are explicitly fixed.
* Its configuration space is closed by definition.

These features make bitspace **unsuitable as ontology**, but **ideal as a model**:

* It represents joint applicability of distinctions.
* It encodes constraint and exclusion relations.
* It supports combinatorial analysis without ontological commitment.

Bitspace therefore functions as a **local probe of structure**, not as a claim about what distinction-space is.

---

## 5. Discreteness vs Closure

The failure of identity here has nothing to do with discreteness.

A structure may be discrete and still non-exhaustible. What is ruled out is not digital form, but **totalization**.

The correct contrast is therefore:

* closed formal system ❌
* open-ended admissibility ✔

---

## 6. Consequences for Modeling

Formal tools—including combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete state spaces—are fully admissible within the Implications phase.

Their use is governed by a single constraint:

> No model may be treated as exhausting the space it represents.

This preserves both rigor and non-fundamentality.

---

## Summary

Distinction-space cannot be identical to bitspace, or to any fully specified formal space, because distinction is constitutively non-closed under reflection.

This non-closure is structural rather than metaphysical and blocks digital ontology without blocking formal modeling.

Bitspace remains a powerful abstraction layer—but only as an abstraction layer.
