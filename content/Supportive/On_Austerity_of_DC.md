# On the Austerity of the Distinction Constraint (DC)

*DC eliminates illegitimate depth, not admissible structure.*

## I. Two Dimensions of Constraint

Constraints can apply in at least two distinct ways:

1. **Foundational admissibility** — conditions under which anything can count as something at all.
2. **Ontological variety** — what kinds of entities, structures, laws, or realities may obtain.

Failure to distinguish these dimensions leads to systematic misclassification of constraint.

The DC applies constraints exclusively along the first dimension.

## II. Foundational Constraint

At the foundational level, DC fixes conditions under which predicates such as “exists,” “is,” “is possible,” and “is fundamental” can be meaningfully applied.

These conditions rule out:

- use of ontological vocabulary without application conditions,
- claims that do not exclude their negations,
- appeals to fundamentality without admissible contrast,
- explanations that attempt to operate prior to the conditions of explanation.

These eliminations are constitutive rather than comparative. They do not rely on, or compete with, any substantive account of what exists.

## III. Absence of Constraint on Ontological Variety

DC imposes no restrictions on:

- the kinds of entities that may exist,
- the number or nature of laws,
- the form of causation or modality,
- whether reality is physical, mathematical, mental, divine, simulated, or otherwise,
- whether there are multiple regimes, worlds, or levels.

Any such posit is admissible provided it can be specified in a way that distinguishes it from not being the case.

No further limitation is imposed.

## IV. Inversion of a Common Distribution of Constraint

Many frameworks restrict ontological variety while permitting unrestricted appeals to fundamentality.

DC reverses this distribution:

- ontological variety is unconstrained,
- foundational privilege is denied.

Claims that ordinarily function as terminal stopping points—claims of ultimate depth, priority, or metaphysical finality—are excluded unless they satisfy admissibility conditions.

This exclusion applies only at the foundational level.

---

## V. Status of Structure

DC does not eliminate structure.

Identity, persistence, regularity, causation, modality, explanation, and ontology remain admissible.

They are treated as patterns of admissible distinction rather than as primitive features requiring further grounding.

What is excluded is the claim that such structure must be underwritten by something more fundamental than the conditions under which structure can be articulated at all.

---

## VI. On the Source of Starkness

Any sense of starkness introduced by DC results from the absence of certain kinds of metaphysical termination:

- no deeper layer beneath admissibility,
- no ultimate explanatory inventory,
- no privileged standpoint outside all distinction.

These absences reflect the location of constraint, not a restriction on what may exist.

---

## VII. Summary

DC is restrictive only with respect to foundational admissibility.

It is permissive with respect to ontological variety.

- Illegitimate depth is excluded.
- Possible structure is not.
- Privilege is denied; possibility is not.

Misclassification arises only when these dimensions of constraint are conflated.
