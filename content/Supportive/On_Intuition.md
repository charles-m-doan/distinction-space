## 1. What Human Intuition Is Actually For

Human intuition did not evolve to track the deep structure of reality.

It evolved to navigate what Richard Dawkins has called the **Middle World**: the range of scales, speeds, and conditions that shaped human survival and everyday experience. This includes:
- mid-sized objects,
- moderate speeds,
- stable environments,
- local causes,
- and short causal chains.

Our intuitions are excellent at:
- catching falling objects,
- tracking persistent things,
- inferring intentions,
- and reasoning about nearby consequences.

They are not designed to handle:
- extremely large or small scales,
- deep recursion,
- abstract constraint systems,
- non-local structure,
- or self-referential models.

Expecting intuition to function reliably in these domains is like expecting eyesight to work for radio waves. The mismatch is structural, not personal.

## 2. Intuition Tracks Objects, Not Structure

Most everyday intuition assumes:
- things persist underneath change,
- causes produce effects,
- explanations terminate in something concrete.

But many successful explanatory frameworks—especially in physics and mathematics—do not operate in terms of objects at all. They operate in terms of:
- symmetries,
- invariances,
- constraints,
- equivalence classes,
- and abstraction layers.

These are not “hard to imagine” because more effort is required.  
They are hard to imagine because **imagination itself is an object-based cognitive tool**.

When explanation shifts from *things* to *structure*, intuition does not deepen. It simply runs out of applicable handles.

## 3. Why Intuition Does Not Return at Deeper Levels

There is a persistent hope that abstraction is temporary:
> “Surely once we go deep enough, explanation will become intuitive again.”

There is no reason to expect this.

Historically, intuition failed early and never returned:
- Relativity eliminated absolute simultaneity.
- Quantum mechanics eliminated classical trajectories.
- Gauge theories eliminated naive physical degrees of freedom.
- Renormalization eliminated simple causal pictures.

Each step displaced intuition further rather than restoring it.

This is not an accident.  
It reflects the fact that intuition was never a reliable guide at these scales to begin with.

There is no guarantee—nor any principled reason to expect—that human-scale intuition reappears at some final “rock bottom” of explanation.

---

## 4. Abstraction Is Not a Detour

At deep levels, explanation does not proceed by:
- adding smaller pieces,
- revealing hidden substances,
- or discovering what things are “really made of.”

Instead, it proceeds by:
- identifying constraints,
- compressing patterns,
- eliminating redundancy,
- and reorganizing distinctions more efficiently.

This form of progress feels unsatisfying only if explanation is expected to *end in a thing*.

That expectation itself comes from Middle-World cognition, not from any requirement of intelligibility.

---

## 5. Conservatism About Models Is Not Irrational

Resistance to new theoretical frameworks is not, by itself, a mistake.

Existing models have:
- survived extensive empirical testing,
- accumulated technical refinement,
- and proven reliable across many domains.

There is no obligation to adopt an alternative model simply because it is different.  
In many cases, skepticism is entirely reasonable.

New abstractions ought to justify themselves by offering something genuinely additional:
- deeper unification,
- greater compression,
- conceptual clarity,
- or extension to new regimes.

Methodological conservatism plays a legitimate role in scientific practice.

---

## 6. Where the Asymmetry Enters

The problem arises when this conservatism is applied **asymmetrically**.

In practice, many alternative models are treated as inherently suspect *even when* they:
- reproduce all existing empirical results,
- are mathematically consistent,
- and make no claims beyond the established domain.

Meanwhile, the dominant formalism is treated as neutral, inevitable, or simply “what the theory says.”

This difference in treatment is rarely justified explicitly.  
It often rests on historical priority rather than principled distinction.

The wave function, the Standard Model, or other entrenched formalisms are not always defended as *fundamental* in name—but they are often treated as such in practice.

---

## 7. Familiarity Quietly Replaces Justification

Once intuition has already failed, all participants are operating in non-intuitive territory:
- Hilbert spaces,
- quantum states,
- gauge redundancies,
- renormalization schemes,
- effective field theories.

None of these resemble Middle-World objects or processes.

Yet a quiet boundary is often drawn:
- familiar abstractions are treated as safe,
- unfamiliar abstractions are treated as speculative.

This boundary is not grounded in intuition—intuition is already gone.  
It is grounded in **habituation**.

What feels solid is what has been lived with long enough.

---

## 8. “Fundamental” as a Practical Stopping Point

Explicit claims of fundamentality are not always made, and they are not always dogmatic.

More often, fundamentality functions implicitly:
- as a signal that further questioning is unnecessary,
- as a cue that inquiry should redirect rather than deepen,
- or as a boundary between “physics” and “interpretation.”

In many cases this is pragmatically defensible.  
Inquiry must stop somewhere to remain productive.

The problem arises only when this stopping point is treated as **principled rather than provisional**, or when alternatives are dismissed without being evaluated by the same standards applied to the incumbent model.

---

## 9. What Consistency Actually Requires

Once inquiry is fully outside the Middle World, the relevant questions are no longer:
- “Does this feel intuitive?”
- “Does it resemble familiar objects?”
- “Is this how we usually talk?”

They are:
- Does it cohere?
- Does it compress structure?
- Does it reduce redundancy?
- Does it extend explanatory reach without contradiction?

If alternative abstractions are rejected, they should be rejected on these grounds—not simply because they challenge an entrenched framework.

Consistency requires that unfamiliar models be assessed by the same criteria that justified the familiar ones in the first place.

---

## 10. A Realistic Expectation

A realistic expectation is this:
- intuition helps locally,
- abstraction dominates globally,
- no final return to the familiar is promised.

This is not pessimism.  
It is a recognition of what human cognition is and is not designed to do.

Deep theory is not required to feel intuitive.  
It is required to remain coherent where intuition cannot go.

---

## 11. Conclusion

If an account of reality feels unintuitive, abstract, or alien, that alone tells us very little.

Human intuition is a tool shaped by evolution for survival in the Middle World—not a universal arbiter of intelligibility.

There is no obligation for deep explanations to restore the comforts of the Middle World.

The demand that they do so is understandable—but it is not reasonable.
