# On the Non-Optionality of Existence Under Constitutive Intelligibility

## Orientation

This step makes explicit a consequence that is already implicit in the Distinction Constraint (DC), but is easily confused: **once absolute non-being is ruled out as unintelligible, existence is no longer a condition that could fail to obtain**.

The aim here is not to introduce a metaphysical thesis, but to clarify what follows *transcendentally* from DC’s eliminations.

Nothing new is added. What is made explicit is what remains once all incoherent contrast positions have been removed.

## 1. What DC Already Establishes

DC establishes the following at the Foundations:

1. **Nothing prior to or outside distinction can count as anything at all.**
2. **“Nothing” as an absolute absence is not an admissible posit**, since it removes the application conditions of all predicates, including “exists” and “does not exist.”
3. **There is no semantic remainder beyond admissible distinction**; ontological vocabulary has no application outside intelligibility.
4. **There is no intelligible contrast position from which reality could be said to outrun intelligibility.**

These claims are eliminative and constitutive, not assertoric.

---

## 2. The Residual Question

DC can be glossed as fixing the *conditions under which* existential vocabulary could apply, while remaining silent on whether anything obtains.

This gloss invites the following residual question:

> Could intelligibility be fully fixed, while nothing obtains?

The purpose of this step is to show that **this question itself presupposes a contrast that DC has already eliminated**.

## 3. Why Absolute Non-Existence Is Not a Live Option

To treat existence as conditional would require an intelligible contrast between:

- intelligibility obtaining, and
- intelligibility failing to obtain.

But DC has already ruled out the second term.

There is no admissible sense in which:
- “nothing obtains,”
- “non-being obtains,” or
- “reality fails to be”

could be articulated without collapsing the conditions of articulation themselves.

This is not because such claims are false, but because **they lack application conditions altogether**.

Accordingly:

> The idea that existence might fail to obtain is not a suppressed possibility; it is an unintelligible one.

## 4. Existence Is Not a Further Condition

From this it follows that **existence is not an additional condition layered on top of intelligibility**.

It is not:
- a property,
- a state,
- a fact to be established,
- or a modal outcome.

Rather:

> “Existence” names the unavoidable fact that intelligibility is already in play, once all incoherent contrasts have been eliminated.

There is no further question of whether being “obtains,” because there is no admissible position from which its failure could be contrasted.

This does not assert *what* exists.  
It does not assert *how* reality is structured.  
It does not introduce necessity, modality, or ontology.

It removes a spurious conditional.

## 5. Consequence for the Status of DC

DC therefore cannot coherently be read as:

> fixing intelligibility while leaving open the possibility that nothing is the case.

That reading quietly relies on the very notion of absolute non-being that DC dissolves.

The correct characterization is instead:

- DC is **silent about ontological inventory**.
- DC is **eliminative with respect to non-being**.
- DC leaves no intelligible contrast in which existence could fail.

This does not convert DC into a metaphysical doctrine.  
It clarifies that DC is **non-optional once articulated at all**.

---

## 6. Summary

- Absolute non-being is unintelligible.
- Therefore, existence is not a condition that could coherently fail.
- “Existence” does not add content beyond intelligibility.
- It names the fact that intelligibility is already operative.

This result is **transcendental, not ontological**.

It follows directly from DC’s eliminations and requires no appeal to intuition, experience, or metaphysical grounding.

---

## 7. Downstream Expression (Non-Foundational)

At the level of summary or pedagogy (not Foundations), this result may be compactly expressed as:

> **To be is to be distinct.**

Understood correctly, this does not define being, but **refuses the idea that being could mean anything beyond admissible distinction**.
