# Rules for Elaborating Roadmap Steps

## 1. One Step, One Claim

Each markdown file must elaborate **exactly one roadmap step**.
The file title must match the step title verbatim and express a single, determinate claim.

## 2. Explicit Dependencies

At the beginning of the file, include a **Dependencies** section that lists:

* The prior step numbers and titles this step relies on.
* Only steps that are logically required, not merely helpful.

Do not re-argue earlier steps except where strictly necessary for continuity.

## 3. Category Annotation

Each file must clearly state the **category** of the step near the top (e.g. conditions of intelligibility, semantic constraint, ontological consequence, metaphysical reconstruction).

Categories are **orienting labels**, not premises. They must not do argumentative work.

## 4. Clarify the Target

Early in the file, specify:

* What the step is **establishing**.
* What kinds of objections it is meant to **block**.
* What it explicitly does **not** claim.

This prevents scope creep and misclassification.

## 5. Use Minimal Commitments

Arguments should rely only on what has already been secured in prior steps and on ordinary standards of sense-making.
Avoid introducing new metaphysical primitives, technical frameworks, or empirical assumptions unless unavoidable.

## 6. Distinguish Unintelligibility from Falsity

When ruling something out, be explicit about whether the result is:

* incoherence,
* unassertability,
* lack of application conditions,
* or straightforward falsity.

Do not collapse these.

## 7. Guard Against Category Slides

Explicitly note when a move is:

* semantic → ontological,
* epistemic → constitutive,
* eliminative → reconstructive.

If a slide is intended, justify it. If not, block it.

## 8. Reflexive Consistency

Ensure the step does not exempt itself from the constraints it articulates.
If the claim applies universally, it must apply to itself.

## 9. No Rhetorical Padding

Avoid:

* persuasive flourishes,
* metaphor doing logical work,
* appeals to authority,
* or anticipatory concessions.

Each paragraph should advance the argument.

## 10. Forward Compatibility

Where appropriate, briefly indicate:

* which later steps depend on this result,
* and what would fail downstream if this step were rejected.

This preserves the integrity of the roadmap as a whole.

## 11. Non-Reactive Framing for Unpublished Frameworks

### Constraint

When elaborating the Distinction Constraint (DC), **do not use phrasing that presupposes reception, feedback, critique, misunderstanding, or dialogue directed at DC itself**.

In particular, avoid constructions that imply:

* that DC has been read, reviewed, or responded to,
* that DC has been misunderstood and is now being clarified,
* that objections have been raised and are being answered,
* or that the framework occupies an established position within an academic discourse.

Such implications are false at the current stage of the project and introduce illicit sociological background structure.

### What Is Allowed

The following are admissible:

* **Anticipatory structural framing**, e.g.:

  * “A likely point of contention concerns …”
  * “A natural fault line arises at …”
  * “A potential misclassification would occur if …”

* **General claims about scientific or philosophical practice**, even when reactive in tone, e.g.:

  * “Successful mathematical frameworks are often treated as metaphysically privileged.”
  * “Foundational programs frequently mistake explanatory power for constitutive authority.”

* **Reactive or critical language directed at external frameworks**, traditions, or methodologies.

These forms anticipate logical or methodological tensions **without attributing any reaction to DC itself**.

---

### What Is Not Allowed

The following are inadmissible in DC documents:

* “DC is sometimes misread as …”
* “This document clarifies …”
* “In response to objections …”
* “Readers may think …”
* “Critics argue …” (when referring to DC)

Such phrasing narrates reception or response and should be replaced with direct structural statements.

---

### Replacement Strategy

When tempted to explain *why* a clarification is being made, instead:

* state the constraint directly,
* state what DC permits or blocks,
* or describe the structural relation at issue.

**Say what is true of the framework, not what the framework is reacting to.**

---

### Diagnostic Test

A sentence is admissible only if it remains true and intelligible in a world where:

> **DC is never read, cited, discussed, or critiqued by anyone.**

If the sentence presupposes readership or response, it violates this rule.

Never imply that DC has been read, critiqued, or misunderstood. Anticipate structural tensions, but do not write reactively about DC itself.
