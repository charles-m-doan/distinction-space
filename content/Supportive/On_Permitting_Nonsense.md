# On Permitting Nonsense

Discourse about reality can either permit anything or impose constraints on what counts as saying something at all. The Minimal Admissibility Framework adopts the latter stance. It treats disciplined intelligibility as a non-negotiable condition for substantive claims, while allowing unrestricted freedom to gesture, remain silent, or invoke ineffability outside that aim. What follows fixes the consequences of this choice and the distinctions it requires.

## I. Optionality in a Trivial Sense

It is trivially possible to permit anything within discourse:

- ineffable being,
- reality beyond all distinction,
- what cannot be said, specified, or contrasted,
- positions that refuse applicability conditions altogether.

Nothing prevents this as a human activity. One may gesture, allude, remain silent, or invoke profundity without constraint.

Such permissiveness is not denied.

What is denied is that it can coexist with the aspiration to make **substantive claims about reality**.

## II. The Cost of Permissiveness

Permitting nonsense is not merely a tolerance for poetic or expressive language. It involves relinquishing:

- determinate disagreement (claims that exclude their negations),
- explanation as distinct from gesture,
- ontological commitment with application conditions,
- modal distinction between what could be otherwise and what could not.

When distinctions are no longer required, *anything* and *nothing* collapse into the same status. Discourse may continue, but it no longer performs the work it appears to perform.

This is not a lamentable outcome. It is a structural consequence.

## III. Quietism and Ineffability as Stances

Quietism and appeals to ineffability are often presented as humility: a refusal to overstep what can be said.

They function instead as epistemic stances rather than contributions to inquiry.

Such stances:

- do not assert claims,
- do not accept refutation,
- do not specify conditions of application,
- and therefore do not participate in the economy of admissible assertion.

This does not render them false. It renders them **non-competitive** with positions that aim to say something determinate about reality.

## IV. A Constitutive Choice

A choice is fixed:

> **Disciplined intelligibility is preferred to maximal permissiveness.**

This choice is not forced by logic alone. It is forced **conditional on an aim**:

> to speak about reality in ways that are answerable, constraining, and exclusionary.

Those who do not share this aim are not in disagreement here. They are engaged in a different activity.

---

## V. Non-Arbitrariness of the Constraint

Although this choice is not logically mandatory, it is not arbitrary.

Permitting nonsense while retaining the vocabulary of reality, existence, fundamentality, and explanation produces a structural asymmetry:

- nonsense becomes immune to criticism,
- while disciplined claims remain exposed.

Such asymmetry is untenable. Either admissibility constraints apply to all claims, or the discourse forfeits its right to those terms.

---

## VI. Scope of the Refusal

Nothing here entails that:

- ineffable reality does not exist,
- silence is illegitimate,
- poetry or mysticism are meaningless activities,
- or that all forms of human sense-making must conform to this framework.

Only the following is fixed:

> **Substantive claims about reality require constraints on admissibility.**

Everything else lies outside the framework’s scope by design.

---

## VII. Classification of Rejection

Positions that take the form:

- “Perhaps reality transcends all distinction,” or
- “What matters cannot be said,”

do not function as internal challenges.

They reject the aim under which admissibility has force.

No response is required beyond that classification.

---

## Closing

One may permit anything and abandon determinate discourse about reality.

Or one may accept constraint and forgo certain gestures of depth.

The latter is chosen.

That choice is the price of saying anything at all.
