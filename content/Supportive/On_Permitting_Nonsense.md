# On Permitting Nonsense

Discourse about reality can either dispense with constraints altogether or operate under conditions that determine what counts as saying something at all. The Minimal Admissibility Framework (MAF) adopts the latter stance. It treats disciplined intelligibility as a constitutive requirement for substantive claims, while allowing unrestricted freedom to gesture, remain silent, or invoke ineffability outside that aim. What follows fixes the consequences of this stance and the distinctions it entails.

## I. Optionality in a Trivial Sense

It is trivially possible to permit anything within discourse:

- ineffable being,
- reality beyond all distinction,
- what cannot be said, specified, or contrasted,
- positions that refuse applicability conditions altogether.

Nothing prevents this as a human activity. One may gesture, allude, remain silent, or invoke profundity without constraint.

Such permissiveness is not denied.

What is denied is that it can coexist with the aspiration to make **substantive claims about reality**.

## II. The Cost of Permissiveness

Permitting nonsense is not merely a tolerance for poetic or expressive language. It involves relinquishing:

- determinate disagreement (claims that exclude their negations),
- explanation as distinct from gesture,
- ontological commitment with application conditions,
- modal distinction between what could be otherwise and what could not.

When distinctions are no longer required, *anything* and *nothing* collapse into the same status. Discourse may continue, but it no longer performs the work it appears to perform.

This is not a lamentable outcome. It is a structural consequence.

## III. Quietism and Ineffability as Non-Participating Stances

Quietism and appeals to ineffability are often presented as humility: a refusal to overstep what can be said.

Functionally, however, such positions do not operate as contributions to inquiry under admissibility constraints. They:

- do not assert claims,
- do not accept refutation,
- do not specify conditions of application,
- and therefore do not participate in the economy of admissible assertion.

This does not render them false, misguided, or illegitimate as human activities. It renders them **non-competitive** with positions that aim to say something determinate about reality.

---

## IV. Aim-Relative Constraint

A constraint is fixed, conditional on an aim:

> **If the aim is to make substantive, answerable, and exclusionary claims about reality, then disciplined intelligibility is non-optional.**

This is not a free-standing preference or policy decision. It is a constitutive requirement that follows once the aim is adopted.

Those who do not share this aim are not in disagreement here. They are engaged in a different activity, to which admissibility constraints simply do not apply.

---

## V. Non-Arbitrariness of the Constraint

Although the constraint is conditional on an aim, it is not arbitrary.

Permitting nonsense while retaining the vocabulary of reality, existence, fundamentality, and explanation produces a structural asymmetry:

- nonsense becomes immune to criticism,
- while disciplined claims remain exposed.

Such asymmetry is untenable. Either admissibility constraints apply to all claims that deploy this vocabulary, or the discourse forfeits its entitlement to it altogether.

---

## VI. Scope of the Refusal

Nothing here entails that:

- ineffable reality does not exist,
- silence is illegitimate,
- poetry or mysticism are meaningless activities,
- or that all forms of human sense-making must conform to the MAF.

Only the following is fixed:

> **Substantive claims about reality require constraints on admissibility.**

Everything else lies outside the framework’s scope by design.

---

## VII. Classification of Rejection

Positions that take the form:

- “Perhaps reality transcends all distinction,” or
- “What matters cannot be said,”

do not function as internal challenges. They reject the aim under which admissibility has force.

No further response is required beyond that classification.

---

## Closing

One may permit anything and relinquish determinate discourse about reality.

Or one may accept constraint and forgo certain gestures of depth.

The latter is not a preference but a **commitment** implicit in the attempt to say anything determinate at all.
