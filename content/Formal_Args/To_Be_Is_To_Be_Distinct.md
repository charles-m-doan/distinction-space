# **To Be Is To Be Distinct**

## **Plain-Language Summary**

This argument claims that existence is not something over and above there being a difference between something being the case and not being the case. For anything to exist, there must be a fact of the matter about it—some way in which reality is one way rather than another. That minimal difference is what “distinction” amounts to.

If nothing distinguishes a purported being from its not being the case, then there is no fact of its existence at all. Such “absolute indistinction” is not a thin or mysterious form of being; it is indistinguishable from there being nothing. Existence therefore requires distinction, not as a condition of meaning or discourse, but as a condition of being itself.

The conclusion is metaphysical: whatever exists does so only insofar as it is distinct from non-being. To be is to be distinct.

## Thesis Argument

**Existence consists in there being a fact of the matter.
Facthood requires distinction between being the case and not being the case.
Therefore, whatever exists exists only insofar as it is distinct from non-being.
Absolute indistinction is not a mode of being but the absence of being.**

## Scope and Aim

This argument is **metaphysical**, not semantic or epistemic.

It concerns what it is for something to *be*, not what it takes for beings to be described, known, or thought about.

It does **not** claim that:

* existence depends on language or concepts,
* beings must be individuated, discrete, or countable,
* reality must be pluralistic or structured.

It claims only that **being requires minimal factive distinction**: that something is the case rather than not.

---

## Core Claims

### 1. Existence is facthood

To say that something exists is to say that there is a fact of the matter—something that is the case.

Existence is not exhausted by:

* names,
* objects,
* substances,
* or abstract “being as such.”

Rather, existence consists in actuality: reality being one way rather than another. Where nothing is the case, nothing exists.

This is not a claim about propositions or truth-bearers. It is a claim about reality itself: existence is inseparable from there being something so.

---

### 2. Facthood requires contrast

For there to be a fact, there must be a difference between:

* its being the case,
* and its not being the case.

If no such difference obtains, then nothing counts as a fact. There is no actuality, no determination, no “so-ness” of reality.

This contrast is not imposed by thought or language. It is the minimal condition for there to be anything that reality is doing rather than not doing.

---

### 3. Contrast just is distinction

A difference between being the case and not being the case is precisely a **distinction**.

No further structure is required:

* not individuation,
* not plurality,
* not relations,
* not predicates,
* not identity conditions.

Distinction here is minimal and ontological: the difference between actuality and its absence.

---

### 4. Indistinct being cannot be factual

A purported being that is not distinct from its non-being does not differ from its not being the case.

But where there is no such difference, there is no fact of its being. Nothing is the case with respect to it.

This is not a limitation of knowledge or description. It is a failure of actuality itself. Nothing has been realized, determined, or made so.

---

### 5. What is not factual does not exist

Existence cannot be ascribed where there is no fact of the matter.

This is not eliminativism about obscure or ineffable realities. It is a constraint on what counts as being anything at all.

Where nothing is the case, there is nothing that is.

---

### 6. Absolute indistinction is non-being

A being that is absolutely indistinct—indistinguishable from its own non-being—is indistinguishable from nothing at all.

Such a “being” does not exist in a minimal or attenuated sense. It does not exist at all.

Absolute indistinction is therefore not a mode of being, but the absence of being.

---

### 7. Identity conclusion: to be is to be distinct

Whatever exists does so only insofar as it is distinct from not being the case.

Existence is nothing over and above this minimal distinction. There is no further metaphysical ingredient required.

Therefore:

> **To be is to be distinct.**

---

## Clarifications

### Distinction is minimal, not structural

This argument does not require:

* multiple entities,
* sharp boundaries,
* discreteness,
* or articulated structure.

It requires only that reality be some way rather than no way.

Continuity, unity, monism, and process remain compatible with the thesis, so long as they involve something being the case.

---

### Distinction is ontological, not linguistic

The distinction at issue is not between sentences or concepts, but between actuality and non-actuality.

Even a reality entirely beyond language would still either be something the case or nothing the case at all.

---

### Why “absolute indistinction” fails

Claims that reality is “beyond distinction” can only be coherent if they mean “beyond certain distinctions.”

If absolutely no distinction obtains—if nothing differs from not being the case—then there is nothing that reality is doing. There is no being there to be beyond anything.

---

## Restatement of the Result

Existence is not grounded in objects, properties, structures, or laws. It is grounded in **factivity**: there being something that is the case.

Factivity requires distinction.
Absolute indistinction cancels facthood.
Therefore, absolute indistinction cancels being.
