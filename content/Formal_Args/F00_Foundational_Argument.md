# Foundations

## Purpose and Scope

The **Foundational Argument** or just **Foundations** of the Distinction Constraint (DC) fix the **constitutive conditions under which anything can count as something at all**. They do not compare metaphysical options, negotiate among ontologies, or preserve pluralism. Their task is to determine what *“being,” “existence,” “possibility,”* and *“reality”* can coherently mean once all illicit surplus has been removed.

The Foundations do not presuppose a boundary between intelligibility and being, nor do they attempt to bridge such a boundary. The guiding claim of the DC is that the apparent distinction between intelligibility and being is a mistake generated by treating existential vocabulary as if it named something over and above the conditions under which anything can count as anything at all. What has been called *“being”* is exhausted by those conditions.

The Foundations are therefore **not neutral**. They are explicitly **eliminative**. Positions that violate the constraints articulated here are not treated as alternative metaphysical views about what exists. They are diagnosed as attempts to deploy ontological or existential vocabulary after removing the conditions under which that vocabulary can function.

The task of the Foundations is **constitutive and exclusionary**: to rule out incoherent uses of ontological language, to delimit admissible starting points, and to fix what claims of existence, non-existence, and possibility amount to. There is no notion of being available outside the constraints fixed here, because those constraints do not limit being-talk—they **constitute it**.

All constructive and reconstructive work belongs to the **Implications**. The Implications introduce no new primitives or foundational commitments. They operate entirely within the admissible space fixed by the Foundations and undertake a further task: to determine whether that space is sufficient to recover the structures ordinarily attributed to the world.

The Foundations are assessed solely by their internal coherence and eliminative force. The Implications test a further ambition of the DC—namely, whether distinction alone suffices. Failure of that further task would undermine the sufficiency ambition of the project, not the constitutive claims of the Foundations themselves.

## Inferential Steps

01. **(F01) To Make Any Claim Is to Draw a Distinction**  
Any act of asserting, denying, referring, or predicating requires a contrast: *this rather than not-this*.  
“Distinction” is used in a minimal, schematic sense: any applicability condition sufficient to differentiate something from its negation. No underlying substrate, bearer, or domain is presupposed.

02. **(F02) Intelligibility Requires Discriminability**  
If no distinction can be drawn even in principle—no contrast, no criterion of application—then no determinate content is present and no claim has been made.

03. **(F03) Any Meaningful Use of “Is” Presupposes Conditions of Application**  
For “X is” or “X exists” to determine anything, there must be conditions under which X would count as what it is rather than not. Absent such conditions, the utterance fails to fix any content.

04. **(F04) Possibility Is a Mode of Meaningful Assertion**  
“X is possible” asserts *possible rather than impossible*. As such, it inherits the same requirement of application conditions as any other meaningful use of “is.”

05. **(F05) Possibility Requires In-Principle Intelligibility**  
If nothing could ever count for or against X’s obtaining—if no distinction could, even in principle, be drawn—then “X is possible” collapses into indistinguishability from “X is impossible,” or from saying nothing at all.

06. **(F06) Minimal Possibility = Distinguishability in Principle**  
No independent modal primitive is admitted. A purported possibility that lacks contrastive conditions is not a possibility.

07. **(F07) Nothing Prior to All Distinction Can Count as Being Anything**  
Any posit described as prior to, outside of, or more fundamental than distinction lacks application conditions. No predicate—including “exists,” “does not exist,” “grounds,” “is one,” or “is prior”—can apply to it.  
Such a posit is not rejected as false relative to an independent ontology, because no such ontology is available. It fails to satisfy the constitutive conditions for counting as anything at all.

08. **(F08) There Is No Residual Ontological Contrast Beyond Distinction**  
Claims that something “exists but cannot be distinguished” do not describe an alternative mode of being. “Exists,” “does not exist,” and “might exist” are distinction-governed predicates. Once all distinction is removed, no ontological contrast remains for “being” to occupy.

09. **(F09) This Constraint Applies Without Exception**  
The claims, criteria, and constraints articulated here are themselves higher-order distinctions operating within the same admissible space.  
No privileged meta-level is exempt from the requirement of intelligibility through distinction.

10. **(F10) No Ontological Surplus Is Admissible**  
Anything that cannot, even in principle, be distinguished cannot count as anything at all. This is not a limitation on reality, but a fixation of what “exists,” “does not exist,” and “might exist” can coherently mean.

11. **(F11) “Reality” Names the Exhaustion of the Admissible**  
“Reality” is fixed as a technical term: not a domain underlying intelligibility, but the **exhaustion of what can count as something at all** under any coherent use of “is.”  
There is no further question of what reality might be “in itself,” because that question presupposes a contrast the Foundations have already shown to be unavailable.

12. **(F12) Any Admissible Talk of Structure Is Talk of Patterns of Distinction**  
Within the admissible space fixed above, terms such as *structure*, *identity*, *persistence*, *regularity*, *modality*, and *explanation* have no application conditions except insofar as they track constraints on how distinctions can combine, recur, stabilize, and exclude alternatives.

No primitive notion of structure, organization, or order is admitted here. This step does not derive or exhibit such patterns; it fixes only that **nothing counts as “structure” unless it can be articulated in distinction-governed terms**. Any use of “structure” that exceeds this role either reintroduces illicit primitives or fails to determine anything.

13. **(F13) There Is No Admissible Remainder Beyond Distinctions and Their Patterns**  
Given the constraints fixed in (F12), there is no coherent sense to “reality” that exceeds what can be articulated through distinctions and the patterns they admit. Appeals to substrates, grounds, or forms of being not capturable—even in principle—by distinction do not describe a deeper layer of reality; they attempt to deploy existential vocabulary after its conditions of application have been removed.

This is not a substantive inventory claim, nor a derivation of structure. It is a closure condition: **once admissible distinction and distinction-patterning are fixed, nothing remains for “being,” “existence,” or “reality” to range over**.

## Clarifications on Constitutive Commitments

### 1. Constitutive, Not Comparative

The Foundations of the DC do not compete with alternative metaphysical theories. They fix the conditions under which any theory could count as making claims at all. Rejection of these constraints is not disagreement within a shared space, but withdrawal from that space.

---

### 2. Exclusion Is a Feature, Not a Bug

The elimination of substrates, fundamental ontologies, and surplus being is not an added metaphysical thesis. It follows directly from the constitutive criteria fixed in the Foundations. Appeals to “being beyond distinction” do not name a thinner or deeper ontology; **the very characterization of such a posit removes—by self-description—the conditions under which claims of being or existence could be made about it.**

---

### 3. On Existence and Non-Existence

The DC does not treat existence as a primitive fact that could obtain independently of intelligibility. “Exists,” “does not exist,” and all modal variants are distinction-governed predicates. Consequently, appeals to what “exists but cannot be distinguished” do not point to a hidden ontology; they attempt to use ontological terms without satisfying the conditions required for those terms to apply.

---

### 4. Promissory Structure Is Explicit

No claim is made in the Foundations that familiar features of the world have already been derived. The sole task here is to **fix the only coherent starting point**. Demonstrating sufficiency belongs entirely to the Implications.

---

### 5. Radicality Is Inevitable

If these constraints are correct, then no weaker framework is coherent. The radicality of the conclusion reflects the minimality of the starting point, not an excess of assumption.

---

## Summary

The Foundations of the Distinction Constraint do not offer one metaphysical view among others. They eliminate a confused contrast at the heart of traditional ontology: the idea that “being” names something over and above the conditions under which anything can count as anything at all.

What remains is not a thinner ontology, but the dissolution of pseudo-ontology. Once the role of distinction is made explicit, the apparent boundary between intelligibility and being disappears—not because it has been crossed, but because it was never there.

The sufficiency of this admissible space is a further question. That question is taken up by the Implications.
