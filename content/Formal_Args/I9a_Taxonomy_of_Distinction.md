# I9a – A Taxonomy of Distinction-Stabilization (Non-Fundamental)

## Category
Ontological abstraction (non-fundamental)

## Dependencies
- **I02 – Identity as Stability of Distinction**
- **I03 – Persistence Without Endurance**
- **I05 – Regularity as Recurrence of Constraint**
- **I06 – Modality Without Primitive Possibility**
- **I09 – Ontology as Abstraction Layer**

## Purpose and Status of This Step

This step introduces a **controlled taxonomy** for describing different regimes of distinction and constraint within the admissible space already fixed by the Foundations and articulated through the preceding implications.

The taxonomy presented here **does not describe stages in the construction of reality, levels of being, or a generative hierarchy**. It introduces no new primitives and fixes no new constraints. Its sole function is **organizational**: to compress and systematize structural differences that have already been established into a usable vocabulary for subsequent steps.

The terms introduced here are **licensed shorthand**, not foundational commitments.

## How to Read This Taxonomy

Each category names a **structural role** that patterns of distinction can play once distinction is already admissible.  
No category describes how reality is produced, how structure arises, or what must exist.

The taxonomy classifies **regimes of stabilization**:

- from minimal discriminability,
- through increasing degrees of constraint,
- to highly interdependent systems of constraint.

These regimes are **not discrete**, **not exhaustive**, and **not ordered in time**. A single system may exhibit multiple regimes simultaneously under different coarse-grainings.

## The Taxonomy

### 0. Distinction

**Definition**  
A *distinction* is the minimal condition under which anything can count as something rather than not. It is not an entity, operation, or event, but the constitutive condition of discriminability.

**Structural Role**  
- Fixes applicability conditions.
- Makes identity, negation, and contrast possible.
- Is presupposed by all further structure.

**Clarifications**  
- Distinction is not performed by an agent.
- Distinction does not occur in a medium.
- Distinction is not temporally prior to anything; it is logically constitutive.

---

### 1. Frame

**Definition**  
A *Frame* names a weak relational context within which multiple distinctions are jointly applicable.

**Structural Role**  
- Supports minimal relational organization (e.g. adjacency, ordering, comparison).
- Allows distinctions to stand in relation without yet constraining one another.
- Enables structural coherence without stabilization.

**Clarifications**  
- A Frame does not impose rules or regularities.
- Frames are not substrates; they do not persist independently.
- The distinction / frame contrast is conceptual, not ontological; they are inseparable in application.

---

### 2. Sieve

**Definition**  
A *Sieve* names a regime in which patterns of distinction function as **constraints on admissible continuation**. Certain relational configurations restrict which further distinctions remain coherent.

**Structural Role**  
- Marks the presence of stabilization.
- Introduces proto-regularity without governance.
- Distinguishes coherent from incoherent extensions relative to a context.

**Key Constraint**  
Sievehood is not identifiable from static configuration alone.  
It is defined by **constraint relations**, not by visible form.

**Clarifications**  
- A Sieve does not select outcomes.
- It does not bias probabilities.
- It does not operate causally.
It names a *structural restriction* on distinguishability.

---

### 3. Mesh

**Definition**  
A *Mesh* names a regime of **interlocking Sieves**, where multiple constraints are mutually dependent and jointly reinforce coherence across a wide range of distinctions.

**Structural Role**  
- Supports deep stability.
- Enables rich relational architecture.
- Sustains multiple compatible patterns under variation.

**Clarifications**  
- A Mesh is not a system in a substrate.
- It is not defined by any particular emergent phenomenon (e.g. agents, spacetime, computation).
- World-like behavior is a possible description of some Meshes, not a defining feature.

---

## Partition (Epistemic Term — Not Ontological)

**Definition**  
A *Partition* is a restriction of description imposed by an embedded perspective within a Mesh. It selects which distinctions are treated as relevant.

**Status**  
- Epistemic, not ontological.
- Describes how systems refer, not how structure is constituted.
- Cannot be global or exhaustive.

**Clarifications**  
- Partitions do not carve reality at its joints.
- They do not correspond to privileged ontologies.
- They track attention, modeling choice, or abstraction scope.

---

## Non-Claims (Explicit)

This taxonomy does **not** claim that:

- reality passes through these categories in sequence,
- these categories are exhaustive or unique,
- any category is more fundamental than another,
- or that any category explains the existence of another.

All such readings are category errors.

---

## License for Downstream Use

From this point onward, the terms **Distinction**, **Frame**, **Sieve**, **Mesh**, and **Partition** may be used as controlled shorthand to describe regimes of stability and constraint already admitted by the framework.

Their use introduces **no additional ontological commitment** beyond the structural implications already derived.

---

## Summary

This taxonomy provides a compact vocabulary for talking about:

- minimal intelligibility (Distinction),
- weak relational coherence (Frame),
- stabilized constraint (Sieve),
- deeply interdependent constraint systems (Mesh),
- and perspective-relative description (Partition).

It is a tool of organization, not a theory of generation.  
Its role is classificatory, not constitutive.

All explanatory and ontological work remains exactly where it belongs.
