# Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)

**Plain-language Summary**

For something to count as real in any meaningful sense, it has to *make a difference* to whether it is the case or not. If a supposed fact would be exactly the same whether it obtained or failed to obtain—if nothing would be different even in principle—then there is no genuine fact there at all. Calling such a situation “real” does no work.

The MFC says that reality cannot include facts that are indifferent to their own obtaining. Being the case must amount to something; it cannot be a null operation. This is not about what can be known or said, but about what it is for something to actually be the case rather than merely be named.

In short: **if “being the case” makes no difference, there is nothing there to count as being the case.**


## **Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC)** Formal Definition.

> *There cannot be a fact whose obtaining makes no difference, even in principle, to whether it obtains rather than does not obtain.*

Equivalently:

> *For something to count as being the case, there must be a minimal distinction between its being the case and its not being the case.*

This principle is **metaphysical**, not semantic or epistemic. It does not concern what can be known, said, or represented. It fixes what counts as *actuality* rather than pseudo-actuality.

## What Rejecting the MFC Commits One To

Rejecting the MFC commits one to the coherence of **difference-free facthood**. Concretely, it requires accepting all of the following as metaphysically possible:

1. **Facts indistinguishable from their non-obtaining**
   States of affairs that obtain, yet are in no respect different from not obtaining—not even with respect to actuality itself.

2. **Actuality with no contrast to non-actuality**
   Being that does no ontological work beyond what non-being already does.

3. **Ontological idleness**
   A notion of “existence” that places no constraints on what counts as existing and excludes nothing whatsoever.

4. **Collapse of factivity**
   The distinction between:

   * something being the case, and
   * nothing being the case
     is no longer a distinction at all.

This is not merely an epistemic humility position. It is a commitment to **metaphysical vacuity**: a reality in which “what is” and “what is not” play identical roles.

## Why These Costs Should Not Be Accepted

### 1. It empties “fact,” “actuality,” and “existence” of their role

The point of invoking facthood or existence in metaphysics is to mark a difference between:

* how reality is, and
* how it is not.

If this contrast is abandoned, the notions of *fact*, *actuality*, and *being* no longer discriminate anything. They cease to function as ontological notions at all.

This is not theoretical minimalism; it is **conceptual abdication**.

---

### 2. It licenses unrestricted pseudo-ontology

Without the MFC, there is no basis for excluding any purported “being,” no matter how inert or vacuous. Every claim of existence becomes equally acceptable, because existence itself imposes no constraint.

Metaphysics becomes incapable of drawing even the weakest line between:

* something being so, and
* nothing being so.

At that point, ontological commitment is indistinguishable from verbal stipulation.

---

### 3. It undermines disagreement about being

If facts can obtain without differing from not obtaining, then no metaphysical disagreement about what exists can amount to more than a difference in labels.

Disputes about being lose their subject matter. Nothing turns on whether one ontology is correct rather than another, because correctness itself no longer tracks anything.

That is not pluralism; it is **ontological collapse**.

---

### 4. It offers no compensating explanatory gain

Rejecting the MFC does not:

* explain obscure phenomena,
* accommodate ineffability,
* secure metaphysical depth,
* or preserve some elusive absolute.

It merely allows one to say that reality might be *absolutely indifferent to being anything at all*.

There is no explanatory payoff commensurate with the cost.

---

## Positive Justification for Accepting the Minimal Factivity Constraint

Accepting the MFC does not impose structure, plurality, discreteness, or articulation on reality. It requires only this:

> *If reality is anything at all, then there must be a distinction between its being the case and its not being the case.*

That requirement is minimal, non-structural, and unavoidable for metaphysics to retain a subject matter.

The principle therefore functions as a **constraint on ontological seriousness**, not as a substantive theory of what exists.

---

## Resulting Position

Once the MFC principle is accepted, the metaphysical thesis follows directly:

* Facthood requires a difference between being the case and not being the case.
* That difference just is minimal distinction.
* Therefore, **to be is to be distinct**.

Rejecting the MFC preserves formal coherence only at the price of rendering “being” idle. Accepting it preserves the minimal contrast required for metaphysics to be about anything at all.

That is the bootstrap point—and it is one metaphysics cannot avoid without dissolving itself.
