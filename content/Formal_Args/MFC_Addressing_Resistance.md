# Likely Objections to the Minimal Factivity Constraint

## Systematic Overview and Replies

### Introduction

The Minimal Factivity Constraint (MFC) states that for anything to count as being at all, there must be a minimal distinction between its being the case and its not being the case. The constraint is not a theory of being, nor an explanation of determinacy, but a **bootstrapping condition**: it fixes what must minimally be in place for determinacy to arise at all.

Most objections to the MFC arise from misunderstanding this role. They treat the constraint as explanatory, substantive, or competitive with other metaphysical views. Once this is corrected, many objections can be addressed together rather than individually.

What follows is an organized presentation of the main families of objections, stated in their strongest form and addressed on their own terms.

## 1. “The MFC Is Trivial or Redundant”

A common reaction is that the MFC does no real work. Saying that being must “make a difference,” it is argued, merely restates that being is not nothing. Any fact, simply by obtaining, differs from its non-obtaining. If so, the constraint excludes nothing substantive and amounts to a tautology.

This objection presupposes that determinacy is already secured and asks what extra constraint the MFC adds. That presupposition is precisely what the MFC targets. The constraint does not redescribe an already fixed notion of being; it specifies the minimal condition under which anything is fixed as being in the first place.

The relevant notion of “difference” is not logical or verbal. It is not the trivial fact that “A” and “not-A” are distinct descriptions. It is the ontological question of whether reality is determined one way rather than another. A purported fact whose obtaining leaves reality exactly as it would be if it failed to obtain does not merely describe being thinly; it fails to determine anything at all.

The MFC’s role is exclusionary, not illustrative. It rules out idle candidates for actuality—putative facts whose obtaining is indifferent to their non-obtaining. That this failure mode is not common in everyday ontology is irrelevant. Entry conditions are not justified by examples but by identifying what would count as failure to enter.

## 2. “The MFC Is Circular or Illicitly Prioritizes Difference”

Another family of objections charges the MFC with circularity. To invoke a distinction between obtaining and not obtaining, it is said, already presupposes determinacy. Worse, by treating difference as an entry condition, the MFC seems to make difference metaphysically prior to being. If difference itself must be determinate to function, a regress appears unavoidable.

These objections treat the MFC as if it were an explanatory principle. It is not. The MFC does not explain how determinacy arises, nor does it ground being in something more basic. It states a **success condition**: what must minimally be the case for determinacy to count as achieved.

Success conditions are not explanatorily prior to what they constrain, and they do not compete for metaphysical priority. They are neither causes nor grounds. Asking what explains the MFC’s difference is therefore misplaced. Bootstrapping principles terminate by design; they do not generate further explanatory demands.

No regress arises because difference is not introduced as an item whose being must be secured. It is the formal contrast that constitutes securing anything at all. Treating it as something that itself requires grounding is to reintroduce the very presuppositions the MFC is meant to make explicit.

## 3. “The MFC Smuggles in Structure or Modality”

A more technical worry is that even the minimal contrast invoked by the MFC requires hidden structure. Distinction, it is argued, presupposes identity conditions, negation, logical space, or modal alternatives. If so, the MFC is not as minimal as it claims to be. Calling difference “primitive” merely masks explanatory emptiness.

This objection conflates **determinacy** with **articulation**. The MFC concerns the former only.

The constraint does not deny that articulation—saying what the difference consists in, how it is structured, or how it relates to other facts—requires logic, modality, or conceptual resources. It denies that such resources are required for determinacy as such. A reality can be fixed one way rather than another without that fixing being internally articulated.

The obtaining/not-obtaining contrast is not analyzed modally. It does not invoke possible worlds, alternatives, or counterfactuals. It marks only success versus failure of determination. Treating this contrast as primitive is not a defect but a necessity: bootstrapping principles must bottom out somewhere. The MFC makes explicit where metaphysical determination stops, rather than covertly presupposing it.

## 4. “The MFC Overreaches and Excludes Legitimate Views”

Some objections argue that the MFC rules out too much. Views involving vague existence, degrees of being, pure actuality, or non-fact-like entities are said to be excluded by stipulation. Not everything that exists, the objection continues, fits a contrastive obtaining/not-obtaining mold.

The MFC excludes far less than this objection suggests. It does not rule out vagueness, gradation, continuity, or non-fact-like ontologies. All of these still determine reality one way rather than another. A vague fact still contrasts with its absence. A process still fixes how reality unfolds rather than leaving everything idle.

What the MFC excludes is narrower and sharper: being that is indifferent to its own determination. Views on which actuality introduces no distinction—on which reality would be exactly the same whether something is or is not the case—fail the minimal condition for being fixed at all.

This is not parochial or theory-laden. It is the weakest possible requirement for ontological determinacy.

## 5. “The MFC Mistakes Quietism for Incoherence”

Finally, some objections appeal to metaphysical quietism or deflation. One can accept ordinary existence claims, it is argued, while refusing to engage in questions about ontological determinacy. The MFC wrongly treats this refusal as a failure of being itself. Moreover, talk of “making a difference” allegedly smuggles in epistemic notions of discriminability.

The MFC does not require theorizing about determinacy. It requires only that determinacy not be denied. Quietism is fully compatible with the constraint so long as it does not claim that existence fixes nothing at all.

Refusing to explain how being is determined is not the same as claiming that being is indeterminate. The MFC targets only the latter. It does not invoke epistemic access, observability, or knowability. Difference is not something that must be detected or represented; it is simply non-indifference in being.

## Conclusion

Once the Minimal Factivity Constraint is understood as a bootstrapping condition rather than a substantive metaphysical thesis, most objections lose their force. They either demand explanation where only an entry condition is being offered, confuse determinacy with articulation, or mistake the exclusion of ontological indifference for the exclusion of rival ontologies.

The MFC does not tell us what being is like. It tells us what must minimally be the case for there to be being at all. If nothing is determined—if obtaining and not obtaining make no difference—then nothing has been fixed as being the case. That is not a controversial doctrine. It is the bootstrap on which determinacy stands.
