# Foundations Roadmap

## Purpose and Scope

This roadmap establishes the **foundational constraints** of the project. Its purpose is not to explain or derive the features of observable reality, but to determine **what must be in place for anything to count as something at all**.

The claims made here concern neither empirical knowledge nor a catalog of beings, but the minimal conditions under which any ontology or epistemology can get a grip at all. The steps that follow identify the minimal conditions of intelligibility, show why distinction is unavoidable, and rule out incoherent starting points such as substrates, bearers, or a “fundamental ontology” prior to distinction. The roadmap is therefore **eliminative of incoherent primitives and delimiting of admissible starting points**, rather than constructive.

By the end of the roadmap, the space of admissible primitives is closed: reality is constrained to the totality of possible distinctions and the patterns they form. No further metaphysical assumptions are introduced or permitted at this stage.

All subsequent work in the project belongs to the **implications** phase. That work proceeds under the constraints established here and is evaluated by whether it successfully derives familiar features of reality using only the resources this roadmap allows.

## Inferential Steps

1. **To Make Any Claim Is to Draw a Distinction**
   Asserting, denying, referring, predicating, and quantifying all require discriminating *this rather than not-this* (or *this rather than that*).

*So:*

2. **Intelligibility Requires Discriminability**
   If nothing can be distinguished even in principle—no criteria of application, no contrasts available under any conceivable conditions—then there is no determinate content and no successful reference.

*Therefore:*

3. **Any Meaningful “Is” Presupposes Conditions of Application**
   For “X is (or exists)” to say anything, there must be some principle by which X would count as what it is rather than not.

*Given this:*

4. **Possibility Is a Mode of Meaningful “Is”**
   “X is possible” is not an ornament on “X”; it is a claim with contrastive force: *possible rather than impossible*.

*So:*

5. **Possibility Requires Intelligibility in Principle**
   If there is nothing that could ever count for or against X’s obtaining—no conceivable discriminating conditions—then “X is possible” does not differ from “X is impossible” (or from saying nothing).

*Hence:*

6. **What Is Possible Is What Is Distinguishable in Principle**
   A “possible” that is in-principle indistinguishable from its negation is not a possibility at all. Minimal possibility = admissible distinction.

*From this it follows:*

7. **A Substrate Prior to Distinction Is Not Describable as Being Anything**
   If a substrate—metaphysical, physical, or explanatory—is prior to all distinction, then no predicate can apply to it (including “one,” “same,” “different,” “exists,” “grounds,” or “is prior”), since each application requires a distinction.

*So:*

8. **A Substrate Prior to Distinction Cannot Be Meant, Referred To, or Asserted**
   It is not an alternative ontology; it is an attempted placeholder for what cannot be given application conditions.

*Therefore:*

9. **There Is No Intelligible Ontological Surplus Beyond Distinction**
   Anything counted as real must fall within the space where distinctions can, in principle, be drawn; otherwise it cannot be anything at all (cannot even be coherently said to be “outside”).

*Accordingly:*

10. **Reality Is the Totality of What Can Count as Something**
    “Reality” names the total domain of what can count as something at all, not what merely counts for us—i.e., everything that can be distinguished in principle, together with the structured relations among those distinctions.

*More specifically:*

11. **The Structure of Reality Consists in Patterns of Distinction**
    Identity, persistence, lawlike regularity, modality, and explanation are higher-order constraints on distinctions—ways distinctions hang together, repeat, and rule out alternatives.

*Taken together:*

12. **Reality Consists in Possible Distinctions and Their Patterns**
    Reality consists entirely in the totality of possible distinctions and the patterns they form; there is no underlying substrate apart from such distinctions, and no intelligible sense of being outside them.
