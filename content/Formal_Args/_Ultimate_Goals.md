# Ultimate Goals

## 1. Establish Distinction as the Sole Primitive

The project aims to show that **distinction** is the only admissible primitive: not an entity, substance, or fundamental ontology, but the minimal condition under which anything can count as something at all.

## 2. Deny the Coherence of Fundamental Ontology

The project rejects the idea of a “fundamental ontology.” Ontology is not foundational but **derivative**—it operates only after distinctions are already in place. Any attempt to ground reality in entities or substrates prior to distinction is unintelligible.

## 3. Exhaust Reality Without Surplus

Reality is identified with the **totality of possible distinctions and the patterns they form**. The goal is to show that there is no intelligible remainder, substrate, or ontological excess beyond this field.

## 4. Show Sufficiency Without Additional Assumptions

A central aim is to demonstrate that distinction alone—together with the combinatorial structure implicit in the space of possible distinctions—is sufficient to account for observable reality, without introducing further primitives or metaphysical commitments.

## 5. Treat Structure as Emergent, Not Fundamental

Spacetime, causality, lawlikeness, persistence, modality, and explanation are to be shown as **emergent patterns of distinction**, not as fundamental features requiring separate grounding.

## 6. Replace Metaphysical Explanation With Structural Derivation

Rather than explaining reality by appeal to underlying “stuff,” the project seeks to **derive familiar features of the world** from constraints on how distinctions can combine, stabilize, and exclude alternatives.

## 7. Maintain Reflexive Consistency

All claims made in the project must themselves respect the conditions they articulate. No step may exempt itself from the requirement of intelligibility through distinction.

## 8. Leave the Project Open but Constrained

The goal is not to fix a final theory of everything, but to **constrain the space of admissible theories** so that any successful account of reality must arise from distinctions and their patterns alone.
