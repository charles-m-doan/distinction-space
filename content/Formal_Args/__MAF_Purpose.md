# The Minimal Admissibility Framework (MAF)

## What MAF Is

This project is a **foundational philosophical investigation into the conditions of intelligibility**, together with a constrained demonstration of their sufficiency. Its aim is not to describe what exists in the first instance, but to determine the minimal conditions under which anything can *count* as existing, being possible, being structured, or being subject to explanation at all—and then to show what necessarily follows once those conditions are fixed.

The project is explicitly structured into two inseparable phases: **Foundations** and **Implications**.

At the foundations level, the project fixes **distinction** as the sole admissible primitive—not as an entity, operation, or mechanism, but as the constitutive condition under which any claim, predicate, or contrast can apply. To assert, deny, or refer is already to operate within a space of distinction. The project makes this condition explicit and treats it as non-optional.

On this basis, the foundations phase:

* Determines which starting points are coherent and which are not.
* Eliminates appeals to substrates, grounds, or “being prior to distinction” as unintelligible rather than false.
* Fixes the meaning of “existence,” “possibility,” and “reality” as internal to the space of admissible distinction.
* Refuses any privileged meta-level exempt from these constraints.

The implications phase then accepts these foundations as fixed and undertakes the constructive task: to show how familiar features of reality arise from the structure already admitted. No new *fundamental* primitives or ontological commitments are introduced. Identity, persistence, regularity, modality, explanation, and lawlikeness are shown to arise as **stable patterns of distinction** and as consequences of how distinctions can combine, stabilize, and constrain one another.

Within this phase, **ontologies are explicitly permitted**—but only as **abstraction layers**, not as foundations. An ontology is treated as a **coarse-graining of distinctions**: a selected set of primitives and relations that compress underlying structure to make derivation, explanation, and practical reasoning tractable at a given level. Ontological primitives are justified by their utility and structural adequacy, not by claims of metaphysical priority.

The project is therefore **constitutive, eliminative, and demonstrative**. It fixes the space within which claims can be made at all, and then shows how increasingly familiar structure can be recovered within that space by moving across abstraction layers rather than positing deeper foundations.

## What MAF Is Not

This project is **not** a metaphysical theory in the ordinary sense. It does not posit a fundamental inventory of entities, substances, or laws. It does not compete with realism, idealism, physicalism, structuralism, or any other “-ism” understood as a claim about what is ultimately real.

It is **not** an empirical project at the foundational level. No observation, experiment, or scientific theory can confirm or disconfirm the foundations, because empirical practices already presuppose distinction, identity, and applicability. Scientific theories enter only in the implications phase, where they are treated as high-level abstraction layers whose primitives are evaluated by explanatory role, not by fundamentality.

It is **not** pluralistic about foundations. Positions that violate the constitutive conditions fixed in the foundations are not alternative metaphysical views; they fail to meet the criteria for intelligibility altogether.

It is **not** a theory of how distinctions arise, are implemented, or are realized **at the foundational level**. Any such account would already presuppose distinction and therefore cannot belong there. Explanatory and generative accounts are instead legitimate tasks of the **implications phase**, where they operate within constrained abstraction layers and without appeal to fundamental ontology.

It is **not** conceptual engineering or a proposal about how language *should* be used. The constraints articulated are treated as unavoidable conditions of meaningful use, not as conventions or recommendations.

Finally, it is **not** an attempt to gesture toward an ineffable reality beyond what can be said. The project denies that there is any coherent sense to “what lies beyond reality” once the conditions for saying anything at all have been exhausted.

## What the Point of the Project Is

The point of the project is to **make the limits of sense explicit**, and to show that those limits are sufficient.

More specifically, its aims are:

1. **To eliminate pseudo-ontology**
   Many persistent debates in philosophy and foundational science rely on terms such as “ground,” “ultimate being,” or “fundamental reality” while removing the conditions under which those terms could apply. The project shows why such debates concern not hidden facts about reality, but failures of intelligibility.

2. **To fix where explanation must stop—and how it can legitimately proceed**
   The project identifies the point beyond which demands for deeper grounding are category errors, while also showing how explanation re-enters through abstraction layers. Explanation is not rejected; it is **re-situated** as layer-relative rather than foundational.

3. **To reconceive ontology as abstraction rather than foundation**
   Ontologies are retained as indispensable tools: coarse-grained sets of primitives that make derivation, modeling, and reasoning practical. What the project denies is that any ontology can claim fundamental status. Ontological disagreement becomes a question of grain, scope, and utility, not of access to ultimate being.

4. **To replace metaphysical fundamentality with structural derivability across layers**
   Instead of asking which ontology is deepest, the project asks how structures at one layer arise from constraints operative at others. What matters is not reduction to a base ontology, but coherence across levels of abstraction within a single admissible space.

5. **To clarify what “reality” can coherently mean**
   Reality is identified not with an underlying substrate, but with the total domain of what can count as something at all under any admissible abstraction. Appeals to what lies “beyond” this domain do not describe a deeper layer of reality; they attempt to step outside the conditions of sense.

The project’s success does not consist in offering a worldview or a final ontology. It consists in showing that **once the conditions of intelligibility are fixed, all ontologies are necessarily non-fundamental**, and that this does not impoverish explanation but makes it precise.

The point of the project is therefore not to be productive in the sense of generating new theories, but **disciplinary**: to determine what philosophy—and, by extension, science—can meaningfully do, how explanatory work is properly organized, and where claims of fundamentality must stop.
