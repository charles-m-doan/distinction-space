# Rules for Elaborating Roadmap Steps

## 1. One Step, One Claim

Each markdown file must elaborate **exactly one roadmap step**.
The file title must match the step title verbatim and express a single, determinate claim.

## 2. Explicit Dependencies

At the beginning of the file, include a **Dependencies** section that lists:

* The prior step numbers and titles this step relies on.
* Only steps that are logically required, not merely helpful.

Do not re-argue earlier steps except where strictly necessary for continuity.

## 3. Category Annotation

Each file must clearly state the **category** of the step near the top (e.g. conditions of intelligibility, semantic constraint, ontological consequence, metaphysical reconstruction).

Categories are **orienting labels**, not premises. They must not do argumentative work.

## 4. Clarify the Target

Early in the file, specify:

* What the step is **establishing**.
* What kinds of objections it is meant to **block**.
* What it explicitly does **not** claim.

This prevents scope creep and misclassification.

## 5. Use Minimal Commitments

Arguments should rely only on what has already been secured in prior steps and on ordinary standards of sense-making.
Avoid introducing new metaphysical primitives, technical frameworks, or empirical assumptions unless unavoidable.

## 6. Distinguish Unintelligibility from Falsity

When ruling something out, be explicit about whether the result is:

* incoherence,
* unassertability,
* lack of application conditions,
* or straightforward falsity.

Do not collapse these.

## 7. Guard Against Category Slides

Explicitly note when a move is:

* semantic → ontological,
* epistemic → constitutive,
* eliminative → reconstructive.

If a slide is intended, justify it. If not, block it.

## 8. Reflexive Consistency

Ensure the step does not exempt itself from the constraints it articulates.
If the claim applies universally, it must apply to itself.

## 9. No Rhetorical Padding

Avoid:

* persuasive flourishes,
* metaphor doing logical work,
* appeals to authority,
* or anticipatory concessions.

Each paragraph should advance the argument.

## 10. Forward Compatibility

Where appropriate, briefly indicate:

* which later steps depend on this result,
* and what would fail downstream if this step were rejected.

This preserves the integrity of the roadmap as a whole.
