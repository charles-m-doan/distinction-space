# Goals of this Project

## 1. Establish Distinction as the Sole Primitive

The project aims to show that **distinction** is the only admissible primitive: not an entity, substance, or fundamental ontology, but the minimal condition under which anything can count as something at all.

## 2. Deny the Coherence of Fundamental Ontology

The project rejects the idea of a “fundamental ontology.” Ontology is not foundational but **derivative**—it operates only after distinctions are already in place. Any attempt to ground reality in entities or substrates prior to distinction is unintelligible.

## 3. Exhaust Reality Without Surplus

Reality is identified with the **totality of possible distinctions and the patterns they form**. The goal is to show that there is no intelligible remainder, substrate, or ontological excess beyond this field.

## 4. Show Sufficiency Without Additional Assumptions

A central aim is to demonstrate that distinction alone—together with the combinatorial structure implicit in the space of possible distinctions—is sufficient to account for observable reality, without introducing further primitives or metaphysical commitments.

## 5. Treat Structure as Emergent, Not Fundamental

Spacetime, causality, lawlikeness, persistence, modality, and explanation are to be shown as **emergent patterns of distinction**, not as fundamental features requiring separate grounding.

## 6. Replace Metaphysical Explanation With Structural Derivation

Rather than explaining reality by appeal to underlying “stuff,” the project seeks to **derive familiar features of the world** from constraints on how distinctions can combine, stabilize, and exclude alternatives.

## 7. Maintain Reflexive Consistency

All claims made in the project must themselves respect the conditions they articulate. No step may exempt itself from the requirement of intelligibility through distinction.

## 8. Leave the Project Open but Constrained

The goal is not to fix a final theory of everything, but to **constrain the space of admissible theories** so that any successful account of reality must arise from distinctions and their patterns alone.

## Overall Strategy: Foundations and Implications

The project is organized around a strict division between **Foundations** and **Implications**. This division is methodological, not rhetorical. Each phase has a distinct task, burden of proof, and standard of success.

### Foundations: Fixing the Conditions of Intelligibility

The foundations phase determines the constitutive conditions under which anything can count as something at all. Its role is **exclusive and eliminative**, not explanatory or comparative.

Foundations do not propose an ontology, a model of reality, or a set of metaphysical primitives. They fix the minimal constraints that any meaningful use of “is,” “exists,” “possible,” or “real” must satisfy. These constraints operate prior to, and independently of, any particular theory about what there is.

The outcome of the foundations phase is a **closed admissibility space**:

* What counts as a coherent starting point is fixed.
* Appeals to substrates, grounds, or being prior to distinction are ruled out as unintelligible.
* No residual notion of reality, existence, or possibility remains outside the space of admissible distinction.

Disagreement at this stage concerns coherence, not empirical adequacy or theoretical preference. A failure here undermines the project outright.

### Implications: Demonstrating Sufficiency

The implications phase accepts the foundations as fixed and introduces **no new primitives, assumptions, or ontological commitments**. Its task is constructive but constrained: to show that familiar features of reality arise necessarily from the structure already admitted.

This phase is responsible for demonstrating that:

* Identity, persistence, regularity, modality, explanation, and lawlikeness can be derived as stable patterns of distinction.
* No appeal to hidden substrates, surplus being, or additional metaphysical machinery is required.
* The admissible space fixed by the foundations is rich enough to recover the structures ordinarily attributed to “the world.”

Where the foundations phase rules out incoherent starting points, the implications phase tests **sufficiency**. Failure here would not reopen foundational questions; it would show that the foundational constraints are inadequate to support reality as ordinarily understood.

### Division of Labor and Burden

All eliminative work belongs to the foundations. All generative work belongs to the implications. Attempts to demand explanation, realization, or grounding during the foundations phase mislocate the burden; attempts to introduce new primitives during the implications phase violate the constraints already fixed.

Together, the two phases aim to show that:

1. Only distinction is admissible at the foundations.
2. Nothing more is needed to account for reality.

The project stands or falls on maintaining this separation without leakage in either direction.
