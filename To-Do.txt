Bitspace model articulation
    - Why bits?
    - Limitations of model
    - Why a random walk?
    - holographic principle relevance
    - encoding, self-reference / recursion

Deeper and more detailed explanations and examples of core concepts

Better presentation - more book-like plain-wording flow of descriptions

Discussion of implications
 - particularly with respect to boundaries (Big Bang, Big Rip, absolute grouping vs absolute symmetry)
 - phenomena: matter, anti-matter, accelerating expansion of spacetime, what is gravity, etc...
 - ontological layering and the impossibility of logical termination
