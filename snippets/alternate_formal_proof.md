# **Substrate Independence from the Minimal Criterion of Existence**

---

## **0. Informal Overview**

**Goal:** Derive **substrate independence** from a minimal, explicit criterion of existence.

**Substrate independence** is the principle that:

> A process depends only on its pattern of distinctions and transitions, not on the particular material that instantiates it.

If a process is realized in biological tissue, then a structurally identical pattern of distinctions and transitions realized in silicon or any other medium realizes the same process.

This result is not assumed. It follows from a minimal commitment about what it means for something to *exist at all*.

## **1. The Minimal Criterion of Existence**

### **EC — The Difference-Making Criterion**

> **To count as part of reality rather than a verbal appendage, something must be capable—at least in principle—of making a difference.  
> Making a difference requires distinctions.  
> Therefore, existence without distinction is empty.**

This is not a logical truth or a theorem. It is an explicit **existence criterion**.

The motivation is simple:

- If the presence or absence of something makes no possible difference,
- then reality would be exactly the same whether it existed or not,
- in which case asserting its existence adds no content.

Such a posit does not extend ontology; it merely relabels the same world.

This criterion excludes not what is *unknown*, but what is **in principle difference-free**.

---

## **2. Why Distinction Is Unavoidable**

### **Axiom A1 — Distinction as Ontological Ground**

> **Reality is exhausted by what can, in principle, make a difference.  
> Since making a difference requires distinction, reality is exhausted by distinctions.**

This is a metaphysical commitment, not a deduction from logic alone.  
Its justification is eliminative:

- Any alleged entity that cannot be distinguished from its absence
- fails to contrast existence with non-existence
- and therefore fails to earn the title “real.”

Rejecting A1 is coherent in words, but it commits one to an ontology containing facts whose presence or absence changes nothing. Such an ontology is inflationary without being substantive.

## **3. No Distinctionless Remainders**

### **Lemma L0 — No Difference Without Distinction**

> **There is no fact whose existence would leave all distinctions unchanged.  
> Any alleged fact that makes no possible difference is not an additional fact about reality.**

This lemma blocks appeals to:
- brute thisness,
- ineffable essences,
- substrate facts that “matter” without affecting anything.

Such appeals do not contradict themselves; they empty “existence” of content.

## **4. Basic Definitions**

### **D1. Distinction-Space**
The abstract space of all coherent patterns of distinctions.

### **D2. Structure**
Any organized configuration of distinctions.

### **D3. Substrate**
A relatively stable structure capable of hosting other structures.  
A substrate is not ontologically prior to structure; it *is* structure.

### **D4. Process**
A structure of distinctions together with lawful transitions between its possible states.  
Temporal sequencing is itself a higher-order distinction-structure.

### **D5. Implementation**
A substructure whose distinctions and transitions are **isomorphic** to those of a process.

Isomorphism means a one-to-one mapping preserving all distinctions and transitions constitutive of the process.

---

## **5. Immediate Consequences**

### **L1. No Primitive Substrate**
Any substrate must be capable of making a difference to exist.  
Therefore, it must be distinguishable and hence structural.

There is no ontologically primitive “stuff” beneath structure.

---

### **L2. All Properties Are Structural**
A property exists only insofar as its presence or absence makes a difference.  
Difference requires distinction.  
Therefore, properties reduce to features of distinction-structure.

---

### **L3. Exhaustiveness of Structural Description**
If two situations differ, the difference must be expressible as a difference in distinctions.  
A difference that leaves all distinctions unchanged is not a difference at all.

---

## **6. Process Identity**

### **D6. Structural Identity of Processes**

> **Two processes are identical if and only if their distinction-structures and transition-structures are isomorphic.**

Justification:

- A process exists only insofar as it makes a difference.
- All difference is captured by distinctions and transitions.
- Therefore, nothing beyond structure remains to individuate processes.

Appeals to intrinsic natures, haecceities, or substrate-specific essences add no difference and therefore no content.

## **7. Substrate Independence**

### **Theorem T1 — Substrate Independence**

> **If two implementations of a process are structurally identical, then they realize the same process.  
> No further fact about the substrates can make one a genuine realization and the other not.**

#### **Proof**

1. Any fact that matters to realization must make a difference (EC).
2. Any difference must be a distinction (A1).
3. A process is exhausted by its distinctions and transitions (D4, D6).
4. Two implementations are structurally isomorphic by definition (D5).
5. Suppose they realized different processes.
6. Then some further substrate fact would have to make a difference.
7. But no such difference exists once all distinctions and transitions are matched.
8. Therefore, no further fact can ground non-identity.
9. Hence, structurally identical implementations realize the same process. ∎

---

## **8. What This Establishes**

1. Substrate independence is **derived**, not assumed.
2. Claims of essential substrate dependence must identify a real difference.
3. Differences that leave all structure unchanged are ontologically empty.
4. Processes are individuated entirely by structure.

---

## **9. Minds and Consciousness**

Minds are processes: highly recursive, self-referential distinction-structures with lawful transitions.

If:
- a mind exists only insofar as it makes a difference,
- and all difference is structural,

then minds are substrate-independent to the same extent as any other process.

Claims that consciousness depends on a specific substrate **without structural difference** assert a difference that makes no difference.

---

## **10. Clarifying the Scope of the Commitment**

This argument does **not** deny:
- unknown entities,
- unobserved processes,
- inaccessible regions of the universe.

It denies only this:

> That there exist facts whose presence or absence would leave reality exactly the same.

Such facts do not deepen ontology; they evacuate it.

---

## **11. Takeaway**

1. Existence requires difference.
2. Difference requires distinction.
3. Therefore, reality is exhausted by distinctions.
4. Structures, substrates, and processes are patterns of distinctions.
5. Process identity is structural identity.
6. Structural identity across substrates entails full realization.

**Substrate independence follows from the minimal criterion of existence itself.**

To deny it is not to offer an alternative ontology, but to allow existence claims that do no work.
