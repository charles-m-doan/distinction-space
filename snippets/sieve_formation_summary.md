At the most primitive layer, the unfolding of distinction is completely unbiased. It is what we would call “pure noise” — not because the underlying space is random, but because our sampling through it is unbiased. The important point is that randomness at this level does not imply the absence of structure. It simply reflects the absence of assumptions. Distinction-space itself is combinatorially rich, and within that richness lie stable, self-reinforcing patterns. As an unbiased sequence of distinctions accumulates, it inevitably encounters these latent structures. Once encountered, these structures bias and constrain further distinctions. These constraints are Sieves.

In other words: the primitive level is unconstrained, but the meta-level is not. Constraint is not a starting assumption; it is an emergent inevitability.
