## Argument: *To Be Is To Be Distinct*

1. **Existence is facthood**
   To exist is for there to be a fact of the matter: for something to be the case rather than not the case.

2. **Facthood requires contrast**
   A fact exists only if there is a difference between:

   * its being the case,
   * and its not being the case.
     Without such a difference, there is no fact.

3. **Contrast is distinction**
   A difference between being the case and not being the case just is a distinction. No further structure is required.

4. **Indistinct “being” cannot be factual**
   What is not distinct from its non-being does not differ from its not being the case. Therefore, there is no fact of its being.

5. **What is not factual does not exist**
   Where there is no fact of the matter, there is no existence to ascribe. This is not ignorance or ineffability, but absence of being.

6. **Absolute indistinction is non-being**
   A purported being that is absolutely indistinct is indistinguishable from nothing at all and therefore does not exist.

7. **Identity conclusion**
   Whatever exists does so only insofar as it is distinct from non-being.
   Therefore, to be is to be distinct.

## Clarifications (non-optional, but non-inflationary)

* This argument does **not** claim that beings must be individuated, discrete, countable, or richly structured.
  It requires only *minimal distinction*: being-the-case rather than not.

* This argument does **not** derive being from language, thought, or discourse.
  The distinction required is ontological: a difference in what is the case.

* This argument does **not** deny mystery, continuity, unity, or monism.
  It denies only *absolute indistinction* as a coherent mode of being.

> **Existence is nothing over and above the minimal distinction between being the case and not being the case.
> Absolute indistinction is not a thin form of being, but the absence of being altogether.
> Therefore: to be is to be distinct.**

That is the argument.
