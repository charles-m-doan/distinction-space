Before you roll your eyes and say, “Oh, this is just It From Bit,” let me assure you: it is not just It From Bit. Yes, that slogan points in a productive direction, but I don’t think it’s literally true. The idea that the universe is “made of” information—little binary bits—is already too concrete, too structured, too much like imagining some ultimate Lego bricks at the bottom of reality.

What I’m proposing requires a subtle inversion of the usual picture.
When we say “It From Bit,” we typically imagine a world composed of units—bits—arranged into patterns. But that entire imagination smuggles in assumptions: discreteness, encoding, storage, causal updating, a substrate that has bits, something that reads them, something that instantiates them.

A distinction-first ontology says something deeper:
The very idea of something being “made of” something else is already an emergent conceptual move. It doesn’t belong at the foundation.

Distinction alone is primitive—not bits, not matter, not fields, not information, not computation.
Everything else, including “bit” itself, is something that only becomes meaningful at far higher layers of the emergent structure.

The universe is not created, but revealed.

The universe does not come into being.
It comes into view.
First to itself, then to us.
