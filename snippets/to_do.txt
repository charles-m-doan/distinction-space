"nothingness" is incoherent - reality is inevitable

distinction is the fundamental primitive, nothing else is fundamental
wave functions are not fundamental
time is not fundamental
rules are not fundamental
mathematics is not fundamental
space is not fundamental
consciousness is not fundamental
etc...

distinction is not ontology - it is the pre-condition for ontology
    - there is no fundamental ontology, because fundamental ontology is incoherent
    - reality is not "made" of anything. It is the recursive unfolding of distinction
    - things are not "made" of distinctions, rather, distinctions are constraints that shape observation

distinction as fundamental implies distinction space

distinction as fundamental implies substrate independence

distinction space has structure
    - in fact it contains all possible structures
    - observation is the filtering of distinction space

qualia and quarks are op codes

consciousness is a mesh - a time-extended constraint pattern

emergence = sieve networks

more is different = sieves + replication yielding a structure robust enough to noise that allows stable meta-layer distinctions
