Here is a direct, concise answer.

## Short answer

It is a valid *derivation*, but not a *compelling argument*, because several steps introduce commitments stronger than they initially appear, and those commitments restrict the result to a particular metaphysical framework rather than forcing it from a neutral starting point.

In other words: the conclusion **does** follow from your axioms, but the axioms are not philosophically mandatory. The proof is internally coherent, but not externally persuasive.

Below is a precise accounting of **where the argument is sound**, **where it is merely stipulative**, and **where alternative metaphysical frameworks resist it without contradiction.**

## 1. What succeeds

### 1.1. Internal coherence

Given:

* A0 (intelligibility requires distinction),
* A1 (distinction is the only ontological primitive),
* identity = structural identity,
* implementation = structural isomorphism,

then **substrate independence follows with logical necessity**.

Nothing further is needed. Your T1 is valid under those definitions.

### 1.2. Performative-vulnerability arguments

The attacks on “distinction is only epistemic” and “distinction is not required for being” are well-formulated versions of transcendental arguments. They succeed in showing:

* any *assertion* presupposes distinction,
* any *contentful negation* presupposes distinction,
* any *ontological primitive* must be pick-out-able (A0).

These points are correct: one cannot employ content without distinctions.

## 2. What does **not** force acceptance

The critical question is: do A0 and A1 follow from unavoidable constraints on ontology, or are they **framework-defining commitments**? Three pressure points arise.

### 2.1. “Intelligibility” does not automatically constrain ontology

A0 assumes:

> Anything unintelligible cannot exist as a primitive.

This is not self-contradictory, but it is **not compulsory**. Many philosophers allow ontological commitments that cannot be fully indicated—e.g., brute dispositions, ineffable qualia, bare substrata, or primitive powers. They accept that human intelligibility does not bound being.

Your A0 excludes these by stipulation. It does not *refute* them.

### 2.2. “Distinction” does not uniquely follow from A0

From A0, you move to:

> Any primitive must be distinguishable → therefore distinction is the only primitive.

But this step admits another coherent option:

> A primitive could be self-individuating or self-presenting without being analyzable into distinctions.

Examples from alternative metaphysical systems:

* **Neutral monism:** a primitive neutral field that differentiates only at derivative levels.
* **Process monism:** a primitive flux whose distinctions are emergent.
* **Continental-style ontologies:** Being as non-differentiated ground, with distinctions as ontic manifestations.
* **Certain quantum gravity proposals:** undifferentiated substrate with emergent relational structure.

All of these **accept A0 at the level of discourse** while rejecting that it directly describes the primitive *in itself*. They claim:

> Distinction arises when representation arises, not necessarily before.

This avoids contradiction because they do not treat the primitive as something that must be fully “indicated.”

### 2.3. The leap from “distinction” to “total distinction-space”

The move:

> Distinction exists → all possible distinction-patterns exist

is not logically required. It is a modal leap: a move from the actuality of distinction to the plenitude of all structurally coherent distinctions. This resembles modal realism or plenitudinous structuralism.

Other metaphysical frameworks allow:

* actual distinctions,
* but not a maximally large combinatorial distinction-space.

Since the proof of substrate independence ultimately uses:

> If two patterns are structurally identical, they are identical simpliciter,

this metaphysical universe must be one where structure *exhausts* being.

But many views deny this:

* Aristotelian hylomorphism,
* substance dualism,
* neutral monism,
* trope theory,
* primitivist physicalism,
* non-reductive functionalism.

All can grant that distinctions exist without accepting that distinctions *determine* ontology fully.

## 3. Where the framework finally narrows

Your framework amounts to **pure structural monism**:

1. Only distinctions exist.
2. All properties are structural.
3. All implementation differences are structural.
4. If structure is the same, nothing can differ.

This validates substrate independence.

But it requires buying the entire package.

A critic can resist without contradiction by denying any of:

* that intelligibility bounds existence,
* that distinction is ontologically basic rather than epistemically basic,
* that structure fully exhausts the nature of processes,
* that isomorphism suffices for identity (the anti-Haecceity stance),
* that the metaphysical space must be maximal.

---

## 4. Final assessment

### Persuasive **within the framework**:

Yes.
The argument is clean, well-motivated, and the proof is valid under your axioms. Substrate independence follows necessarily.

### Persuasive **as a general metaphysical argument**:

Not fully.
Because:

* A0 is a strong stipulation not universally accepted.
* A1 is not forced by A0.
* The move from A1 to a fully combinatorial distinction-space is optional.
* The identity of processes with their structures is not universally accepted (antihaecceitism is a substantive thesis).

Thus the argument is best understood as:

> A demonstration that **if** one accepts structural monism grounded in distinction as the sole primitive, **then** substrate independence is unavoidable.

It is not yet an argument that structural monism itself must be accepted.
