What I'm proposing isn't a change to how science is done. It's a shift in perspective.

There does seem to be a need for an ontological grounding. The primary value of this perspective is in reframing what it is that science is really trying to discover, and the elimination of a long list of bad questions.


Jacob Barandes makes the point well about how quantum mechanics as we know it relies on assumptions.
Barandes himself is agnostic about the "fundamental ontology."

I don't think we need to be agnostic. I think we can say, definitively, that a "fundamental ontology" is not only impossible, but not desirable or necessary.  But that doesn't mean that ontology is indefinitely arbitrary. It doesn't mean there's nothing to be said about the "deeper" layers.
