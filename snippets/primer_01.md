What I'm proposing isn't a change to how science is done. It's a shift in perspective.

There does seem to be a need for an ontological grounding. The primary value of this perspective is in reframing what it is that science is really trying to discover, and the elimination of a long list of bad questions.


Jacob Barandes makes the point well about how quantum mechanics as we know it relies on assumptions.
Barandes himself is agnostic about the "fundamental ontology."

I don't think we need to be agnostic. I think we can say, definitively, that a "fundamental ontology" is not only impossible, but not desirable or necessary.  But that doesn't mean that ontology is indefinitely arbitrary. It doesn't mean there's nothing to be said about the "deeper" layers.


Barandes quote:
"The idea that the fundamental ontology is state vectors or wave functions in a Hilbert space is very appealing. It would mean we already know what the fundamental grounding of all reality is--a Hilbert space. There's some Hilbert space, and there's an object or objects in Hilbert space and that IS the fundamental ontology of everything. I'm not saying that. Hilbert spaces are not fundamental in this picture. We go back to really having to be kind of metaphysically humble. We know about some systems; some systems appeart to be particles, some appear to be fields, maybe particles are emerging from fields and we don't need particles as a separate category. Maybe fields are fundamental, maybe they're not. I think it's premature to try to guess what the fundamental ontology is just yet, and in this picture you don't have to. You just pick whatever ontology you need for the model you want to talk about--particles, fields, registers on a computer--and then you proceed from there."

-- Jacob Barandes, on the "Theories of Everything" podcast with Curt Jaimungal

I don't think it's premature to guess at what the fundamental ontology is. I'm pretty sure I know what it is. An illusion. There is no fundamental ontology. There is only distinction and recursion.

The above quote is one of many from many different theorists working in different frameworks and areas of physics, philosophy, and cosmology, where an opinion about ontology is expressed. What does seem more or less universal is the sense that it's important, but that nobody wants to be so daring as to suggest what a fundamental ontology might actually be.  There are those who assert that it's the wave function, or whatever else... but they seem to be a shrinking minority.  Instead the "respectable" position is being ontology-agnostic, averting one's eyes from the assumptions one must make to choose a particular flavor of QFT, etc...
