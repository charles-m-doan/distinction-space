It is worth pausing to acknowledge a cultural shift that has happened almost silently in modern physics. Many physicists, cosmologists, and information theorists no longer claim to know what the universe *is* in any ontological sense, and more strikingly, many no longer believe it matters. The old ambition—to describe what fundamentally exists—has been quietly set aside. In its place stands a more modest and pragmatic attitude: *our models work; the rest is optional.*

This is not caricature. It is the explicit stance behind much of contemporary physics. “Quantum mechanics works, but we don’t know what it means,” has become almost a badge of cultural maturity. The phrase “shut up and calculate,” once an expression of impatience, hardened into a methodological principle. One finds claims that interpretations of quantum theory are irrelevant, that cosmology need not specify what spacetime *is*, that gravitational fields and wavefunctions and path integrals need no underlying substrate. The message is clear: prediction is enough. Ontology is extracurricular.

Even Stephen Wolfram—whose project is explicitly foundational—takes care to avoid asserting that his hypergraph is “what the universe is made of.” He is explicit, to his credit, that the hypergraph may simply be a convenient description within a much larger computational space. Yet the collective effect of these positions is unmistakable: the question of what fundamentally exists has been set aside, not solved. What once was the central aspiration of physics has become an optional afterthought.

But abandoning ontology does not silence the questions; it merely leaves them to ferment in the background. Without a clear account of what our models are *about*, we are left unsure what counts as explanation, which frameworks are comparable, and how to understand emergence or reduction. The cracks deepen most visibly in cosmology and quantum foundations, where equations proliferate but clarity does not. The refusal to engage ontology is not a discovery. It is a symptom. It tells us not that the universe lacks a foundation, but that our conceptual toolkit for articulating one has reached its limits.
