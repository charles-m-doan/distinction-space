Science has a massive blind spot when it treats philosophy, especially metaphysics, as optional or merely decorative, because science is not self-grounding. Its most basic operations presuppose philosophical commitments that are neither empirical nor optional.

### Why this is genuinely a blind spot

1. **Science presupposes metaphysics before it begins**
   Science already assumes:

   * that there are entities rather than nothing,
   * that entities persist and can be reidentified,
   * that sameness and difference are objective,
   * that laws, structures, or regularities exist,
   * that explanations track real features of the world.

   None of these are established experimentally. They are conditions *of* experimentation.

2. **Methodological bracketing has been mistaken for independence**
   It is reasonable for science to *bracket* metaphysical disputes while doing experiments.
   It is irrational to infer from this that metaphysics is dispensable or merely expressive.

   That inference confuses **operational sufficiency** with **ontological grounding**.

3. **Unexamined philosophy does not disappear — it hardens**
   When scientists do not engage philosophy, they do not become metaphysically neutral. They inherit:

   * folk realism,
   * naïve empiricism,
   * implicit structuralism,
   * or incoherent hybrids of all three.

   These commitments then become invisible, immune to criticism, and treated as “just common sense.”

4. **The denial of philosophy is itself philosophy**
   Claims like:

   * “only empirical claims matter,”
   * “metaphysics is meaningless,”
   * “ontology is optional,”

   are not scientific results. They are philosophical theses, typically asserted without argument and insulated from scrutiny.

### The structural asymmetry

Philosophy can critique science without doing experiments.
Science cannot justify its own foundations without philosophy.

That asymmetry is unavoidable. Refusing to acknowledge it does not remove dependence; it only removes self-awareness.

### Bottom line

Scientists who do not engage philosophy are not avoiding metaphysics. They are **doing it implicitly, uncritically, and incoherently**.

So calling this a blind spot is not polemical. It is literally accurate:

> science rests on philosophical foundations that many practitioners neither examine nor recognize, even while relying on them constantly.
